It also goes without saying that this approach to computing shares its own challenges the most echoed being security. Security concerns herein, birthed by the exposure of the cloud to different threats, continue to cast doubts on potential users and it's only befitting that such concerns are addressed. Users who entrust their data to the cloud want their data to be secured in the strongest terms possible. Once data leaves the user, the onus is on the cloud provider to provide the required security since data now lies within their perimeter of jurisdiction. But security requirements do change with time and this therefore calls for a continuous process of evaluating the security status of the cloud system. This paper proposes a model of analyzing the security status of the cloud system with regards confidentiality, integrity and availability. We employ state transitions of a conceptual finite state machine, Boolean algebra and logic to evaluate the various states of the system when a specified breach occurs. The scope of this paper is limited to user data on the cloud and not as it traverses the network between the user and the provider.","","978-1-4673-8515-2","10.1109/CCI.2016.7778962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778962","cloud computing;threats;state transitions;Boolean logic","Cloud computing;Security;Computational modeling;Analytical models;NIST;Software as a service","Boolean algebra;cloud computing;finite state machines;security of data","integrated state transition-Boolean logic model;security analysis;cloud computing;security requirements;security status evaluation;cloud system;confidentiality;integrity;availability;conceptual finite state machine;Boolean algebra","","","","20","IEEE","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For each Unix process, the user credentials, which are user identifiers, determine the process privilege, including whether a process has gained a high privilege, such as that of the superuser. The state transition technique is applied to a suitably defined process state, identified by certain classes of user credential values. A transition takes place when these values change from one class to another. These states are clearly defined, and prohibited state transitions as well as some supporting rules are identified. When many break-ins succeed, either the rules are violated or these prohibited transitions occur, and this implies a violation of system security policy. A specially modified system call, ktrace0, is used by the superuser to monitor the process-state and state transition analysis is applied to the traced information, by the Intrusion Detection System. Tests show that most known security violations belonging to the targeted classes (such as buffer overflow exploits) can be detected (and possibly pre-empted) while the constituent activities are still being processed in the kernel.","1063-9527","0-7695-0346-2","10.1109/CSAC.1999.816050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=816050","","Intrusion detection","security of data;Unix","process state transition analysis;security breach detection;computer system;Unix process;user credential;user identifiers;process privilege;superuser;prohibited state transitions;break-ins;system call;ktrace;process state monitoring;traced information;Intrusion Detection System","","3","","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The basic working principle of DAG-based ledgers is to validate new transactions by previous transactions in order to be added to the system. During the tip selection process in the unsteady regime, the state transition probability refers to the probability of a transaction changing from the initial state to an arbitrary state. The state transition probability plays an indispensable role in the performance and security analysis of the IoT relying on DAG-based ledgers. In this paper, we derive the exact expression and an approximate expression of the state transition probability, which both are in closed form. In addition, we propose and analyze three performance metrics, i.e., the expected cumulative weight, the expected number of steps, and the confirmation failure probability, which are derived from the state transition probability and greatly enrich the performance analysis and evaluation of the IoT. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations are carried out to verify the derived analytical results and provide insight into the IoT using DAG-based ledgers.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2023.3265259","Guangdong Guangxi Joint Science Key Foundation(grant numbers:2021GXNSFDA076001); Guangxi Major Projects of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2020AA21077007,2020AA24002AA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10093973","Blockchain;direct acyclic graph;forking topology;markov chain monte carlo algorithm;state transition probability","Internet of Things;Consensus protocol;Security;Throughput;Scalability;Distributed ledger;Periodic structures","","","","","","","IEEE","6 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we classify common consensus algorithms based on how they decide the order of system state changes. We then determine the extent to which each category prioritizes scalability, decentralization, and security. As with other engineering design scenarios, this is a choose-two tradeoff. Our key contribution is that, based on this taxonomy of tradeoffs, we are able to discern the types of consensus algorithms that work well within the application area(s) for a given distributed system. We find that a dichotomy of algorithms between leader-based and voting-based consensus algorithms emerges from this taxonomy.

This paper presents a state transition model to describe the dynamic behavior of intrusion-tolerant systems. This model provides a framework from which we can define the vulnerability and the threat set to be addressed. We also show how this model helps us to describe both known and unknown security exploits by focusing on impacts rather than specific attack procedures.

However, in the case of high-dimensional data, deep learning faces the problems of long training time, lack of explainability and transferability. In this paper, we propose a model based on fuzzy integral for observing and modeling the state of the system. Firstly, the fuzzy integral algorithm has lower complexity, which is more suitable for the time-sensitive financial industry. Then, based on the fuzzy integral, the vector composed of the fuzzy measures of all the features is used to represent the state of the system. It is proved that the system constructed by this modeling method has the Markov property. Moreover, compared with deep learning, fuzzy integral-based methods are not only more computationally efficient but also explainable and transferable.

The security of ICS has drawn the attention of many researchers since successful cyber-attacks against ICS can cause extensive damage in the physical world. Most of the existing literature describes solutions to protect an ICS against attacks directly targeting its underlying IT infrastructure. However, there are comparatively less works that focus on detecting cyber attacks against the physical process itself. Detection mechanisms that do so are said to be process aware. In this paper, we propose a time-based process aware intrusion detection system (IDS) that detects attacks against a physical process by leveraging its regular nature and temporal properties.

Therefore, the use of reasonable spare inventory strategy, as well as maintenance and support decisions to systems is essential to improve system availability, security and system cost reducing. Maintenance strategy can be formulated based on the situation in which the products are monitored. For a single-component system, current research around its multi-state transferring have been quite mature, in which the conversion rate defined in a different state in Markov process can be clearly showed by conversion relationship between different state. However, the state transition process involved mostly considers the processes of repairing only, and rarely considers the impact to system availability by the transition of failure rate caused by changes in components, spare replacement strategies and spare supply. To solve this problem, this paper considered a single-component system with two derating states, and discussed its steady-state availability through variable spare replacement probability and different spare fill rate levels. With model of the system with two derating states established, generalized Markov method was used to solve the relationships between replacement timing and system availability with the level of spare fill rate considered. Finally, through the analysis of results, the preliminary conclusions were obtained. The results could clearly reveal the impacts of spare replacement strategy and spare fill rate in single-component system.","2166-5656","978-1-4799-7958-5","10.1109/PHM.2014.6988248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6988248","single-component;multi-states;replacment stategy;degradation system;system availability","Availability;Maintenance engineering;Steady-state;Markov processes;Equations;Mathematical model;Reliability engineering","cost reduction;inventory management;maintenance engineering;Markov processes","optimal replacement strategy;degradation system component;system availability;support process;equipment system;spare inventory strategy;turnaround time;product maintenance strategy;system support time;support decision;security;system cost reduction;single-component system;multistate transferring;Markov process;conversion relationship;state transition process;failure rate;spare replacement strategy;spare supply;steady-state availability;spare replacement probability;spare fill rate level;derating states;generalized Markov method;replacement timing","","","","8","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The general idea is to organize the state transitions of a multilevel state machine into distinct sets called modes. Roughly speaking, each machine mode is totally secure when considered in isolation of all other modes. Covert channels can therefore only occur when the machine executes a mode change decision; thus the name, mode security. The claim that all covert channels in a mode secure system are connected with mode change decisions can be satisfied by a generalization of the Turing test model of non-information flow.<>","","0-8186-5675-1","10.1109/RISP.1994.296593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=296593","","Central Processing Unit;Information security;Data security;System analysis and design;Data systems;Resource management;System testing;Upper bound;Multilevel systems;Secure storage","systems analysis;security of data;probability;automata theory","covert channel suppression;mode security;state transitions;multilevel state machine;machine mode;mode change decision;mode change decisions;Turing test model;non-information flow","","7","","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Vulnerability, Network and Attack are the main taxonomy classes in the ontology. Vulnerability class describes various types of vulnerabilities in the network which may in hardware components like storage devices, computing devices or networks devices. Attack class has many subclasses like Actor class which is entity executing the attack, Goal class describes goal of the attack, Attack mechanism class defines attack methodology, Scope class describes size and utility of the target, Automation level describes the automation level of the attack Evaluation of security status of the network is required for network security situational awareness.

As a consequence, once the violation is addressed, no clear path exists for reinstating the flagged client beyond having the network operator reset the controller or manually implement a state change via an external command.

Some previous studies have adopted formal methods, but their models cannot express parallel communication completely. This limitation gives rise to problems where web functions, such as a cache that stores contents, cannot be defined and attacks that forge contents cannot be analyzed. These problems are present in the Alloy-based implementations of current models that do not have the ability to express temporal logic. Therefore, we design implementation and evaluation of temporal logic in Alloy to express time series and parallel computation for web security analysis. In doing so, state transitions in the web can be expressed by fitting them in our proposed syntax. As concrete applications, we describe a web security model that includes caches and show that our proposed syntax can analyze state-of-the-art attacks, such as unauthorized access to users' account pages via caches.

State transition analysis is a new approach to representing computer penetrations. In STAT, a penetration is identified as a sequence of state changes that take the computer system from some initial state to a target compromised state. The development of the first USTAT prototype, which is for SunOS 4.1.1, is discussed. USTAT makes use of the audit trails that are collected by the C2 basic security module of SunOS, and it keeps track of only those critical actions that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration.

Therefore, this paper provides a different approach to network security based on Petri net and Attack tree models. Our objective is to analyze the FCSNS security via the combination of model and state. This method represents the network structure and state transferring by way of Petri net.

Fins protocol as one of the most popular protocols is built into a larger number of Ormon devices that are used in different kinds of measurement, and control systems and has been targeted as the desirable candidate for cyber-attack. However, the traditional detection method based on traffic analysis and function code compliance detection is unable to detect mode-switching attack that is consistent with the protocol syntax, and it is a very harmful network attack against industrial devices. In this paper, we analyze the defects of measurement and control system using Fins protocol, launch mode-switching attack against Ormon PLC devices and display how to defend against this attack by designing a detection rules insert into Snort.

Recent trends of IP piracy and reverse-engineering are causing major revenue loss to the IP vendors. A large majority of hardware IPs comes in register transfer level (RTL) description due to their portability and flexibility to map to any technology platform. In this paper, we propose a key-based security through obscurity approach for protecting RTL hardware IPs. The RTL design is first transformed into a technology-independent gate-level description and the functionality of the resulting gate-level netlist is then changed through modification of its state transition function. This process allows normal operation only on the successful application of a correct initialization sequence. The modified gate-level design is then decompiled to generate an obfuscated version of the RTL. Major RTL constructs and macros are optionally preserved through the transformation process using a forward annotation file. The proposed methodology differs from existing hardware obfuscation as well as watermarking techniques in its ability to achieve simultaneous functional and semantic obfuscation for RTL description of IP at low design overhead. Simulation results for a set of open-source IP cores show that we can achieve high levels of security through a well-formulated obfuscation scheme incurring nominal area, delay and power overhead.","","978-1-4244-4805-0","10.1109/HST.2009.5224963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5224963","Hardware IP Protection;IP piracy;RTL obfuscation","Protection;Watermarking;Cryptography;Open source software;Reverse engineering;Hardware design languages;Design methodology;Computer security;Registers;System-on-a-chip","industrial property;integrated circuit design;reverse engineering;security of data;system-on-chip;watermarking","system-on-chip designs;register transfer level hardware IP;bug-free hardware intellectual property cores;IP piracy;reverse engineering;register transfer level description;key-based security;technology-independent gate-level description;watermarking techniques;correct initialization sequence","","23","4","13","IEEE","28 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An anti-attack switched event-triggered mechanism (ATASETM) is designed by considering the impact of ADoS attacks on the systems. Based on the mechanism, the entire time interval is split into rest intervals, continuous detection intervals, residual intervals, and ADoS active-attack intervals. The closed-loop system (CLS) is represented as a three-mode switched system by merging these intervals. Subsequently, a three-piecewise Lyapunov function is constructed for fewer conservative criteria to ensure that the CLS is $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ exponentially stable. An exact expression of the relationship between the decay rate and length of the dormant- and active-attack intervals is obtained. On the basis of the proposed criteria, a joint-design strategy is developed in terms of linear matrix inequalities for the desired trigger matrix and feedback gain. Lastly, a satellite control system and an inverted pendulum model are used to validate the ATASETM-based stability analysis and $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ security control approaches. Numerical results demonstrate that the maximum allowable exponential decay rate decreases with increasing attack time (and vice versa), and the optimal $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ performance level becomes worse as the attack time or the difficulty of the event triggering increases.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2023.3243095","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61503002); Anhui Provincial Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:202004a07020028); National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2020R1A2C1005449); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039713","Denial-of-service attacks;event-triggered control;  $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$   control;networked control systems;piecewise Lyapunov function","Control systems;Security;Switches;Denial-of-service attack;Lyapunov methods;Control theory;Symmetric matrices","asymptotic stability;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;feedback;H∞ control;linear matrix inequalities;Lyapunov methods;networked control systems;pendulums;switching systems (control)","ADoS active-attack intervals;anti-attack switched event-triggered mechanism;aperiodic DoS attacks;ATASETM-based stability analysis;closed-loop system;CLS;continuous detection intervals;denial-of-service attacks;dormant- attack intervals;feedback gain;H∞exponential stability;joint-design strategy;linear matrix inequalities;maximum allowable exponential decay rate;residual intervals;satellite control system;switched event-triggered H∞ security control approaches;three-mode switched system;three-piecewise Lyapunov function","","6","","59","IEEE","7 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The machine must be able to communicate its state and have the capacity to alert the humans when an expected state transition doesn't happen as expected. Things will go wrong, either by accident or as the result of an attack, and the humans are going to need to troubleshoot the system in real time‐that requires understanding on both parts. Each time things go wrong, and the machine portion doesn't communicate well, the human portion trusts it a little less. Humans and machines have different strengths. Humans are flexible and can do creative thinking in ways that machines cannot. But they're easily fooled. Machines are more rigid and can handle state changes and process flows much better than humans can. But they're bad at dealing with exceptions.","","9781119643463","10.1002/9781119653554.ch8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9822331.pdf&bkn=9820866&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Passwords;Government;Engineering profession;Social networking (online);Logic gates;Law enforcement","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

To maintain the availability of the control system, the availability of anomaly detection itself is important. This paper considers a third-party monitoring system with multiple anomaly detection functions. The third monitoring system devotes control systems to control operations instated of security operations. Also, when a control system is subjected to a high-level cyberattack which loses control and security functions, it is expected that the multiple detection functions allow the operator to detect the abnormality earlier. Our proposed system uses two redundant PLCs for sequence control, and one of them is for normal operation, and the other one is for anomaly detection. They operate in conjunction, and when the cyberattacked PLC deviates from the normal operation, the anomaly detection PLC turns on the LED to make it easier to recognize visually, and determines that it is an anomaly. The cyberattack detection method is that the anomaly detection PLC always holds the normal state transition information of the control PLC, and the former PLC always monitors that of the latter PLC. Only when an abnormality occurs, the former PLC detects it as an abnormality. The display method of the detection way is shown by using three types of LEDs. By LEDs turning on or off, the operator can recognize which status is abnormal. The LED lighting state is shown in the state transition diagram, and we explain the superiority of the third-party monitoring system incorporating multiple detection methods.","2474-2325","978-1-7281-6667-4","10.1109/SII46433.2020.9026265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9026265","","Anomaly detection;Control systems;Clocks;Monitoring;Manipulators;Light emitting diodes","control engineering computing;industrial control;Internet;programmable controllers;security of data","security functions;multiple detection functions;sequence control;normal operation;anomaly detection PLC;cyberattack detection method;secured control;industrial control systems;industrial controllers;programmable logic controllers;control system;multiple anomaly detection functions;security operations;third-party monitoring system","","3","","10","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a graphical evolutionary game model is developed to solve the equilibrium of competitions between virus propagations and countermeasures, which helps to evaluate the cyber-security risk of power systems under long-term virus-based intrusions. In the proposed game model, the virus is supposed to propagate itself in a cyber network connecting cyber nodes belonging to power substations. Each cyber node may play as an attacker or a defender according to its state. A death-birth rule is adopted to model probabilistic strategies and state transfers, which reflects the bounded rationality of the viruses. Then, an evolution dynamic equation is derived to obtain the portion of the infected substations when the equilibrium is reached, and simulation algorithm is also given to estimate the infection probability of each substation under the persistent virus-based intrusion. Assuming a virus may trip all breakers in the infected substation, the cyber-security risk is evaluated to identify system-level vulnerabilities. The IEEE 118-bus system with a layered cyber network is used for case studies.

Software that heavily interacts with the underlying OS (e.g., I/O intensive and event-driven applications) suffers from system call overhead. To deteriorate this situation, security vulnerabilities in modern processors have prompted kernel mitigations that further increase the transition overhead. Particularly system-call-heavy applications have been reported to be slowed down by up to 30% with kernel page-table isolation (KPTI), the widely deployed mitigation for the Meltdown vulnerability. To decouple system calls from mode transitions, we revisit an old idea known as system-call batching or multi-calls: the bundling of system calls into a combined call, which only incurs the mode-transition costs of a single one. And then, we have implemented ESCA scheme to adapt system-call batching to Linux-based servers in the light of Meltdown and Spectre, effectively eliminating the slowdown of KPTI-affected applications. Our evaluation shows that the throughputs of real-world applications, benefiting from ESCA, can be improved with only 2 lines of code changed respectively: Nginx by up to 12%, lighttpd by up to 23%, and Redis by 4%.

Such an automatic decision making engine can assist power system operators and network administrators to make a faster response to prevent cascading failures and attack escalation respectively. The hybrid nature of the engine makes the reward and state transition model of the MDP unique. Value iteration and policy iteration techniques are used to compute the optimal actions.

In this article, a dynamic Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model is proposed. The conditional random field (CRF) is introduced into the BLP model to optimize the rules. First, the model formalizes the security attributes, states of system, transition rules, and constraint models on the basis of the state transition of CRFs. After the historical system access logs are processed as the original dataset, a feature selection method is proposed to extract the requests and current states as feature vectors. Second, this article presents a rules training algorithm based on L-BFGS to implement the study and training of datasets, and then marks the logs in the test set through Viterbi algorithm automatically. On the base of these, a rule generation algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust the access control rules based on the current security status and events of the system. Third, the security of CRFs-BLP is proved by theoretical analysis. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the model are verified by estimating the value of the precision, recall, and F1-score.

FSMs should be accurately extracted for watermark insertion, fault injection assessment of control paths in a system-on-chip (SoC), information leakage assessment, control-flow reverse engineering in RTL abstraction, logic obfuscation, etc. However, it is quite unfortunate that, as of today, existing state-of-the-art synthesis tools cannot provide accurate and reliable extraction of all FSMs from the provided high-level RTL code. Precise identification of all FSM state registers and the pure combinational state transition logic described in the RTL code with numerous registers and other combinational logic makes it quite challenging to develop such a solution. In this paper, we propose a framework named RTL-FSMx to extract FSMs from high-level RTL codes written in Verilog HDL. RTL-FSMx utilizes node-based analysis on the abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the RTL code to isolate FSM state registers from other registers. RTL-FSMx automatically extracts state transition graphs (STGs) for each of the detected FSM state registers and additional information of the extracted FSMs. Experimental results on a large number of benchmark circuits demonstrate that RTL-FSMx accurately recovers all control FSMs from RTL codes with various complexity and size within just a few seconds.","2378-2250","978-1-6654-6270-9","10.1109/ITC50671.2022.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9983935","Register Transfer Level;FSM Extraction;HDL Code Analysis;Security Assessment;FSM Automata Theory","Codes;Automata;Watermarking;Benchmark testing;Very large scale integration;Registers;Complexity theory","finite state machines;graph theory;hardware description languages;logic design;reverse engineering;system-on-chip","accurate extraction;accurate finite state machine extraction;control FSMs;control-flow reverse engineering;detected FSM state registers;extracted FSMs;fault injection assessment;finite state machines;high-level RTL code;information leakage assessment;precise extraction;pure combinational state transition logic;register-transfer level description;reliable extraction;RTL abstraction;RTL-FSMx utilizes;security vulnerability assessment solutions;state transition graphs;state-of-the-art synthesis tools","","","","68","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The focus of this paper is the design of a DOK security service that provides for enforcing both local security policies, related to the security of local autonomous databases, and federated security policies, governing access to data aggregates composed of data from multiple distributed databases. We propose Global Access Control, an extended access control mechanism enabling a uniform expression of heterogeneous security information. Mappings from existing Mandatory and Discretionary Access Controls are described. To permit the control of data aggregation, the derivation of unauthorized information from authorized data, our security framework provides a logic-based language, the Federated Logic Language (FELL), which can describe constraints on both single and multiple states of the federation. To enforce constraints, FELL statements are mapped to state transition graphs which model the different subcomputations required to check the aggregation constraints. Graph aggregation operations are proposed for building compound state transition graphs for complex constraints. To monitor aggregation constraints, two marking techniques, called Linear Marking Technique and Zigzag Marking Technique, are proposed. Finally, we describe a three-layer DOK logical secure architecture enabling the implementation of the different security agents. This includes a Coordination layer, a Task layer, and a Database layer. Each contains specialized agents that enforce a different part of the federated security policy. Coordination is performed by the DOK Manager, enforcing security is performed by a specialized Constraint Manager agent, and the database functions are implemented by user and data agents.","1558-2183","","10.1109/71.970557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=970557","","Distributed control;Control systems;Data security;Information security;Distributed databases;Access control;Kernel;Database systems;Aggregates;Logic","distributed object management;authorisation;distributed databases;software agents;security of data","Distributed Object Kernel;federated database system;distributed object systems;graph-based approach;DOK security service;local security policies;federated security policies;data aggregates;multiple distributed databases;global access control;access control mechanism;heterogeneous security information;mandatory access controls;discretionary access controls;unauthorized information;logic-based language;Federated Logic Language;FELL;state transition graphs;Linear Marking Technique;Zigzag Marking Technique;logical secure architecture;aggregation control;security agents;coordination layer;task layer;database layer;DOK manager;constraint manager agent;user agents;data agents;data aggregation;CORBA","","4","7","27","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In simple terms, DT is described as a virtual replica of a given physical product, system, or process. It consists of three major segments: the physical entity, its virtual counterpart, and the connections between them. While the data is collected from a physical entity, processed at the virtual layer, and accessed in the form of a DT at the application layer, it is exposed to several security risks. To ensure the applicability of a DT system, it is imperative to understand these security risks and their implications. However, there is a lack of a framework that can be used to assess the security of a DT. This paper presents a framework in which the security of a DT can be analyzed with the help of a formal verification technique. The framework captures the defense of the system at different layers and considers various attacks at each layer. The security of the DT system is represented as a state-transition system and the security properties are captured in temporal logic. Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is used to verify the systems against these properties. In particular, the framework is used to analyze the probability of success and the cost of various potential attacks that can occur at each layer in a DT system. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated with the help of a detailed case study in the healthcare domain.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3257171","Computer Science and Engineering Department and the Open Access Program from the American University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10068532","Digital twin security;security analysis;probabilistic model checking;Markov decision process;discrete time Markov chain","Security;Medical services;Sensors;Probabilistic logic;Model checking;Digital twins;Real-time systems","cyber-physical systems;digital twins;formal verification;health care;probability;production engineering computing;temporal logic","application layer;digital twin framework;Digital Twins;DT system;given physical product;physical entity;probabilistic model;security analysis;security properties;security risks;smart energy;smart healthcare;smart manufacturing;smart mobility;state-transition system;virtual counterpart;virtual layer;virtual replica","","","","85","CCBYNCND","14 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authors analyze the TCP code via a ""reverse engineering"" technique called ""program slicing"" to identify several of these vulnerabilities, especially those that are related to the TCP state-transition diagram. They discuss many of the flaws present in the TCP implementation of many widely used operating systems, such as SUNOS 4.1.3, SVR4, and ULTRIX 4.3. The corresponding TCP attack ""signatures"" (including the well-known 1994 Christmas Day Mitnick Attack) are described, and recommendations are provided to improve the security state of a TCP-based system (e.g., incorporation of a ""timer escape route"" from every TCP state).

This approach is based on a probabilistic extension of the value-passing Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS), which is a common formal language for modeling concurrent systems. Our approach gives a uniform security model for different security scenarios. We present then a uniform algorithm for computing the Nash equilibria strategies on this security model. In a nutshell, the algorithm first generates a network state transition graph for our security model, then simplifies this transition graph through graph-theoretic abstraction and bisimulation minimization. Then, a backward induction method, which is only applicable to finite tree models, can be used to compute all the Nash equilibria strategies of the (possibly infinite) security models. This algorithm is implemented and can be tuned smoothly for computing its social optimal strategies, and its termination and correctness are proved. The effectiveness and efficiency of this approach are demonstrated with two detailed examples from the field of network security.","2324-9013","978-1-5090-3205-1","10.1109/TrustCom.2016.0078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846961","Network security;Nash equilibria strategies;Formal method;Probabilistic value-passing CCS","Security;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic;Communication networks;Reactive power;Games;Analytical models","calculus of communicating systems;computer network security;formal languages;game theory","modelling;network security scenarios;game theory;network security games;probabilistic extension;value-passing calculus of communicating systems;CCS;formal language;concurrent systems;uniform security models;Nash equilibria strategies;network state transition graph;graph-theoretic abstraction;bisimulation minimization;backward induction method;finite tree models","","1","","23","IEEE","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method involves the establishment of a state transition matrix of CPPS based on a dynamic Bayesian network and analysis of the triggering law of cascading faults. A dynamic HMM model and a set of expected risk scenarios of CPPS are established based on the observable results of physical system faults by the information system.

Information exchange occurs only when feedback between the participants of the communication process is possible in media space, and also when each social actor is given the opportunity to act as a subject of media communication. In this case, the possibility of information exchange within the framework of subject-object and subject-subject media communication relations is guaranteed mainly by the digital infrastructure of media tools and media platforms, through which the involvement of social actors in communication processes aimed at the implementation of public management to address socially important issues of life support, social significance and security is ensured. Social media communication is a factor of the digital public administration and forms its main qualitative characteristics and properties. Without the inclusion of actors of the public sphere in the digital media communication processes in the modern realities it is impossible to realize the conditions of the digital public administration, including the assessment of the effectiveness of its implementation and parameters of manageability. In this regard, the media and communication framework of the phenomenon of «governability» in the system of digital public management is the subject of this study. In strategic terms, governability in the system of the digital public administration is determined by its network organization instead of the classical hierarchical forms of interaction of public administration actors (see L.V. Smorgunov. Governability and network public administration, 2014). «Network» concept is considered by various authors in terms of public administration approach, therefore in the scientific literature it is also called the theory of political-management networks. Emerged together with the concept of new public management, the concept of political networks is based on the same postulates: the state changes the usual hierarchical form of administration to a new form of management. The difference between the two approaches lies in the fact that while in the new state management, market relations prevail over hierarchy, in the concept of political networks, communication processes play a key role in managerial and political processes. And, accordingly, the network organization of the digital public administration emerges through communication links of actors in the public sphere, which are formed in the digital media space. Spatial and infrastructural «turn» of digital media communications is considered by the author as a theoretical and methodological constant in identifying the set of factors of public management and the special properties and characteristics of media environments, in which the implementation of digital public management is possible.","2768-4873","979-8-3503-2003-9","10.1109/ComSDS58064.2023.10130416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130416","Governability;digital public administration;media communications","Seminars;Social networking (online);Semantics;Decision making;Organizations;Media;Security","public administration;social networking (online)","communication links;communication process;digital infrastructure;digital media communication processes;digital media communications;digital media space;digital public administration system;digital public management;information exchange;media communication framework;media environments;media platforms;media tools;network public administration;public administration actors;public administration approach;social actor;social communication;social media communication;subject-subject media communication relations","","","","18","IEEE","25 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite of the convenience in collecting information to provide the decision basis for the users, the vulnerability of embedded sensor nodes in multimedia devices makes the malware propagation a growing serious problem, which would harm the security of devices and their users financially and physically in wireless multimedia system (WMS). Therefore, many researches related to the malware propagation and suppression have been proposed to protect the topology and system security of wireless multimedia network. In these studies, the epidemic model is of great significance to the analysis of malware propagation. Considering the cloud and state transition of sensor nodes, a cloud-assisted model for malware detection and the dynamic differential game against malware propagation are proposed in this paper. Firstly, a SVM based malware detection model is constructed with the data sharing at the security platform in the cloud. Then the number of malware-infected nodes with physical infectivity to susceptible nodes is calculated precisely based on the attributes of WMS transmission. Then the state transition among WMS devices is defined by the modified epidemic model. Furthermore, a dynamic differential game and target cost function are successively derived for the Nash equilibrium between malware and WMS system. On this basis, a saddle-point malware detection and suppression algorithm is presented depending on the modified epidemic model and the computation of optimal strategies. Numerical results and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm can increase the utility of WMS efficiently and effectively.","1673-5447","","10.1109/CC.2018.8300282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8300282","Internet of Things;wireless multimedia system;state transition;malware propagation;differential game","Malware;Cloud computing;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Multimedia communication","cloud computing;computer network security;game theory;Internet of Things;invasive software;multimedia communication;radiocommunication;topology","Internet of Things;malware suppression framework;cloud-assisted malware detection;saddle-point malware detection;modified epidemic model;WMS devices;malware-infected nodes;SVM based malware detection;state transition;wireless multimedia network;system security;topology;malware propagation;multimedia devices;embedded sensor nodes;dynamic network service infrastructure;dynamic differential game;IoT;wireless multimedia system","","19","","","","21 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper views the security level as a user's inherent property that is only correlated with the user's behaviours and the situated context and independent of the suffered attack ways. We propose a formalized methodology to especially quantify the security level in real time from the perspective of state transition probability through estimating the stable probability of staying in the security state in inhomogeneous continuous time Markov chain. This paradigm enables users to customize the security protection mechanisms for adapting to the frequently varying context. We conduct the extensive numerical calculations and empirical analysis to comprehensively investigate the response of the proposed security quantification framework to the various combinations of the concerned parameters, e.g., SNR, velocity, and traffic flow. The results show that the proposed framework is capable of capturing the real-time security level adaptively to the vehicular context and provides a dependable decision basis to security protection, which can restrict the security to a target value.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2598155","National Nature Science Foundation(grant numbers:61373123,61572229,U1564211); Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Scholars; International Scholar Exchange Fellowship Program of Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies; Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Automotive Simulation and Control(grant numbers:20120108); Jilin University Young Teacher and Student Cross Discipline Foundation(grant numbers:JCKY-QKJC09); Jilin Provincial International Cooperation Foundation(grant numbers:20140414008GH,20150414004GH); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7534771","Vehicular ad-hoc networks;security;Markov process","Vehicular ad hoc networks;Signal to noise ratio;Real-time systems;Intelligent vehicles;Context awareness;Markov chain","computer network security;data protection;Markov processes;mobile computing;numerical analysis;real-time systems;vehicular ad hoc networks","computational security;context-aware system;vehicular ad-hoc networks;VANET;signal-to-noise ratio;SNR;traffic flow;security protection mechanisms;node state;node location;user inherent property;user behaviours;formalized methodology;state transition probability;inhomogeneous continuous time Markov chain;vehicular context;real-time security level;security quantification framework;empirical analysis;extensive numerical calculations","","11","","39","OAPA","5 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the attacks become more variable and complex, there is an urgent need for dynamic defense methods. In this paper, we propose a security function virtualization (SFV) based moving target defense of SDSG which makes the attack surface constantly changing. First, we design a dynamic defense mechanism by migrating virtual security function (VSF) instances as the traffic state changes. The centralized SDN controller is re-designed for global status monitoring and migration management. Moreover, we formalize the VSF instances migration problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem with multiple constraints and design a pre-migration algorithm to prevent VSF instances' resources from being exhausted.

The salient features of VANET, such as highly dynamic connections, sensitive information sharing, and unreliable fading channels, make the security quantification challenging. Accurate measurement for VANET security depends on the sufficient understanding of “context”, or making sense of the states, environment, or situation. This article proposes a context-aware security quantification scheme for VANET based on the Markov chain. Firstly, a Homogeneous Continuous-Time Markov Chain (HCTMC)-based security state model is designed for VANET. The value of each state of the HCTMC is determined with a value function that incorporates the security strength of transmitted data, dynamic and randomness of the vehicular channel, and transmission delay of the current situated environment of VANETs. Finally, the state transition matrix is derived based on the Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain (HDTMC) and Homogeneous Poisson Process (HPP). Simulation results show that the security quantification method enables the VANET's system to adopt context-aware defense strategies according to the situated environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3017557","National Nature Science Foundation(grant numbers:61572229,6171101066,61872158,61806083); Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Development Foundation(grant numbers:20170204074GX,20180201068GX,20190103051JH); Jilin Provincial International Cooperation Foundation(grant numbers:20180414015GH); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9170576","Security quantification;VANET;Markov chain;state transition","Security;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Markov processes;Delays;Adaptation models;Vehicle dynamics","Markov processes;probability;stochastic processes;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","context-aware defense strategies;context-aware quantification;VANET security;Markov Chain-based scheme;context-aware security quantification scheme;homogeneous continuous-time Markov chain;security strength;Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain;security quantification method;VANET system;security state model;fading channels;sensitive information sharing;HCTMC;HDTMC;state transition matrix;vehicular channel;transmission delay;homogeneous Poisson process;HPP","","11","","27","CCBY","18 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

User position is also considered when various access points changed states. Moreover, the algorithm also verifies the legitimacy of a fire alarm by measuring the change in temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels, thus defending against manipulative attackers. The experiment conducted in this paper used a combination of sensors, microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi and ZigBee communication to identify user behavior at various access points and implement the logical sensing algorithm. In the experiment, the proposed logical sensing algorithm was successfully implemented for a month in a studio apartment.

Its novel callback mechanism and virtual network device connection capability cost-effectively enhance user controlled testing intelligence for verifying protocols with complicated state transitions.

Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on CPS devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks). Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a new security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics. We first present a general method for reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program (i.e., causal dependencies between the physical context/event and program control flows), including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we then present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (eFSA). eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of CPS control programs and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if a specific physical event is missing along with the corresponding event dependent state transition. We evaluate our prototype's performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi incurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity checking, and 0.063s~0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency checking.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2019.2906161","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:ONR-N00014-17-1-2498); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:OAC-1541105); Security and Software Engineering Research Center; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8669815","Cyber-physical systems;data-oriented attacks;program anomaly detection;cyber-physical execution semantics","Runtime;Semantics;Anomaly detection;Sensors;Hidden Markov models;Security;Process control","cyber-physical systems;data integrity;finite state machines;program control structures;reasoning about programs;security of data","cyber-physical system security;malicious attacks;control-oriented attacks;code-reuse attacks;data-oriented attacks;noncontrol data attacks;runtime execution semantics checking;program control;event identification;dependence analysis;program behavior model;event-aware finite-state automaton;CPS control programs;event checking;physical event;runtime attacks;cyber-physical contextual consistency checking;event dependent state transition;cyber-physical execution semantics reasoning;runtime data-oriented exploit detection;event-aware program anomaly detection;code-injection attacks;Orpheus;causal dependencies;Raspberry Pi;state transition integrity checking","","17","","79","IEEE","19 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, the 5G system, state transition properties and security properties were abstracted from 3GPP specifications. To mimic an attacker’s behavior, a Dolev-Yao adversary model was constructed in the 5G model by empowering it with NAS signalling security testing knowledge and reasonable security capabilities in the wireless channel. Then we used the TAMARIN prover to verify all the abstracted properties one by one and discovered some protocol vulnerabilities based on the counterexamples found. We further verified these vulnerabilities on the testbed and identified 10 new 5G protocol vulnerabilities. Moreover, we analyzed the root cause of these vulnerabilities and concluded that all of them were caused by the unconditional trust between UE and gNodeB. Therefore, we propose an improved PKI mechanism based on the existing asymmetric encryption of 5G. Besides the existing public-private key pair of the home network, we introduce a new pair of asymmetric keys in the gNodeB to encrypt and sign the signalling message sent to UE. The gNodeB can be connected only when the verification succeeds and then the RRC connection can be initiated. This mechanism can effectively avoid all the vulnerabilities found in this paper.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2937997","National Natural Science Fund for Innovative Research Groups(grant numbers:61521003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801515); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8817957","5G;protocol security;privacy;NAS;formal method;public key infrastructure","5G mobile communication;3GPP;Protocols;Authentication;Systematics;Analytical models","3G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;signalling protocols;telecommunication security;wireless channels","RRC connection;home network;public-private key pair;asymmetric encryption;UE;TAMARIN;5G protocol vulnerabilities;5G nonaccess stratum signalling security;signalling message;gNodeB;NAS signalling security testing knowledge;Dolev-Yao adversary model;3GPP specifications;state transition properties;improved PKI security mechanism;formal analysis;systematic analysis method","","9","","47","CCBY","28 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The PRO3, which is integrated with a high-speed line card, attempts to accelerate the performance of the firewall by implementing key functionality in hardware and by optimizing the balance between hardware and software functions. In this way, significant performance enhancements can be achieved, such as making transport control protocol (TCP) and Internet protocol (IP) data transactions secure, and protecting and separating virtual private networks (VPNs) from the external public network. The PRO3 incorporates an innovative scheme—a reduced instruction set computing (RISC)-based pipelined module with line-rate throughput—that makes it possible to process high- and low-level streaming operations efficiently.

Since load shedding is the last resort for keeping security, the annual expectation of the load shedding cost is used as a security index to evaluate the overall benefits of VAR resources which respond in dynamic state transitions in contingencies. The proposed formulation takes into account the multiple benefits of reactive power in a single problem, which may be useful to evaluate the real value of the VARs.

DPI aims to identify various malware (including spam and viruses) by inspecting both the header and the payload of each packet and comparing it to a known set of patterns. DPI is often performed on the critical path of the packet processing, thus the overall performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of DPI. The seminal algorithm of Aho-Corasick (AC) is the de facto standard for pattern matching in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Basically, the AC algorithm constructs a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) for detecting all occurrences of a given set of patterns by processing the input in a single pass. The input is inspected symbol by symbol (usually each symbol is a byte), such that each symbol results in a state transition. Thus, in principle, the AC algorithm has deterministic performance, which does not depend on specific input and therefore is not vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks, making it very attractive to NIDS systems. In this paper we show that, when implementing the AC algorithm in software, this property does not hold, due to the fact that contemporary pattern sets induce very large DFAs that cannot be stored entirely in cache. We then propose a novel technique to compress the representation of the Aho-Corasick automaton, so it can fit in modern cache. We compare both the performance and the memory footprint of our technique to previously-proposed implementation, under various settings and pattern sets. Our results reveal the space-time tradeoffs of DPI. Specifically, we show that our compression technique reduces the memory footprint of the best prior-art algorithm by approximately 60%, while achieving comparable throughput.","2325-5560","978-1-4244-8456-0","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5985996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5985996","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Software algorithms;Encoding;Pattern matching;Software;Throughput","authorisation;computer networks;Internet","software-based deep;space-time tradeoffs;packet inspection;network intrusion detection;prevention systems;Web application firewalls;DPI;packet processing;deterministic finite automaton;state transition;algorithmic complexity attacks;NIDS systems;AC algorithm;Aho-Corasick automaton;compression technique","","14","2","25","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the fast processing speed of symmetric key encryption methods, due to the problem in key exchange, hybrid encryption solves the security problem of key exchange using asymmetric key method. The asymmetric-key method is difficult to provide smooth services due to the decrease in processing speed caused by computational complexity. The hybrid method is designed to take advantage of the fast processing speed of the symmetric-key, and the secure exchange method of the key used in the symmetric-key operates by using the asymmetric-key. However, with the advent of quantum computer technology, encryption techniques using the asymmetric-key method are changing in the same way as increasing the key size used. Therefore, we will explain the AI application method using the state change of Rubik’s cube to generate keys in the latest state in the symmetric-key encryption system. The application of the Rubik’s cube state change algorithm, which operates on the AI base described in this paper, has the advantage of inducing and using the used key without exchanging the pre-shared key. Because of this key induction method, malicious attackers have little information on the keys used for encryption and decryption, so it is judged that the confidentiality and integrity of key generation and management can be secured more safely. We intend to improve the problem of key exchange and management in existing encryption systems by generating and managing keys through the Rubik’s cube state change algorithm, which operates based on AI.","1976-7684","978-1-6654-6268-6","10.1109/ICOIN56518.2023.10048916","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10048916","Artificial intelligence;key generation;symmetric-key encryption method;cryptography;Information security","Web and internet services;Focusing;Receivers;Companies;Speech recognition;Encryption;Internet","artificial intelligence;computational complexity;cryptography","AI application method;asymmetric key method;hybrid symmetric key encryption methods;key exchange;key generation method;key induction method;key management method;pre-shared key;Rubik's cube state change algorithm;secure exchange method","","","","8","IEEE","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The importance of semantics is widely recognized, as well. Indeed, there exists several solutions to the problem of providing semantics to web services, most of them relies on some form of Description Logic. This paper presents an integration of model checking and semantic reasoning technologies in an efficient way. This can be considered the first step towards the usage of semantic model checking in problems of security verification. The approach relies on a representation of services at the process level that is based on semantically annotated state transition systems (ASTS) and a representation of specifications that is based on a semantically annotated version of the computation tree logic (AnCTL). The proposed approach permit to perform an efficient and yet useful, semantic reasoning at process-level about web services. Indeed, this paper proves that model checking for ASTS and AnCTL is sound and complete and it can be accomplished in polynomial time.","","978-1-4244-6830-0","10.1109/HPCS.2010.5547125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5547125","Semantic Web Service;State Transition System;Temporal Description Logic;Model Checking","Web services;Semantics;Authentication;Ontologies;Companies;Semantic Web","formal specification;formal verification;security of data;temporal logic;Web services","semantic model checking;security requirements;Web services;formal verification method;description logic;semantic annotated state transition systems;specification representation;computation tree logic","","2","","27","IEEE","12 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sequential logic locking, watermark insertion, fault-injection assessment of a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) control flow, information leakage assessment, and reverse engineering at gate-level abstraction, to name a few, require precise FSM extraction from the synthesized netlist of the design. Unfortunately, no reliable solutions are currently available for fast and accurate extraction of FSMs from the highly unstructured gate-level netlist for effective security evaluation. The major challenge in developing such a solution is precise recognition of FSM state flip-flops in a netlist having a massive collection of flip-flops. In this paper, we propose FSMx-Ultra, a framework for extracting FSMs from extremely unstructured gate-level netlists. FSMx-Ultra utilizes state-of-the-art graph theory concepts and algorithms to distinguish FSM state registers from other registers and then constructs gate-level state transition graphs (STGs) for each identified FSM state register using automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) techniques. The results of our experiments on 14 open-source benchmark designs illustrate that FSMx-Ultra can recover all FSMs quickly and precisely from synthesized gate-level netlists of diverse complexity and size utilizing various state encoding schemes.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2023.3266368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10098877","FSM Automata Theory;FSM Extraction;Netlist Analysis;Security Assessment","Logic gates;Registers;Security;Encoding;Automata;Data mining;Flip-flops","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Unfortunately, as of today, there are no good solutions available that can provide very fast and accurate extraction of FSMs from the flattened netlist to perform effective security assessment. The difficulty of developing such a solution lies in precisely identifying FSM state flip-flops present in a netlist that contains numerous circuit flip-flops. In this paper, we propose to develop a framework called FSMx to extract FSMs from highly unstructured synthesized designs. FSMx utilizes graph theory to identify FSM state registers from other registers. FSMx automatically extracts gate-level state transition graphs (STGs) for each of the detected FSM state registers.

First, safe communication problems in systems are analyzed. Then, based on the Security and Safety Modeling (SESAMO) method, safe building blocks for communication are designed and combining these building blocks with Safe-COE mechanism, a kind of Safe-COE communication architecture is proposed. Finally, communication performance is tested based on this architecture. The results show that based on the general Ethernet MII bus interface, the minimum communication cycle could reach 125 μs , and the minimum synchronization accuracy of peripherals control could be about 100 ns. Moreover, the formal modeling method is used to verify the safe integrity of this architecture. The results show that the architecture could meet related safe requirements of attack protection, data validation, disconnect monitoring, and state switching.

In this paper, a synergistic combination of Surrogate Augmented Lagrangian Relaxation and branch-and-cut is presented. With system coupling constraints relaxed and quadratic penalties on constraint violations added, the augmented Lagrangian is innovatively linearized and decomposed into subproblems to be solved by branch-and-cut. Subproblem solutions are then effectively coordinated based on Surrogate subgradients with much reduced computation requirements and multiplier zigzagging, and accelerated reduction of constraint violations.

Highly dynamic and possibly unpredictable environments, and uncertain operating conditions call for new paradigms of software design, and run-time adaptation mechanisms, to overcome the lack of knowledge at design time. Main application areas include vehicles or robots that need to collaborate to achieve a common task, e.g., minimize fuel consumption, moving objects at a construction site, or performing a set of operations in a factory. Moreover, these vehicles or robots need to interact and possibly collaborate with humans in a safe way, e.g., avoiding accidents or collisions, and prevent hazardous situations that may harm humans and/or machines. % This paper proposes a framework for developing safe and secure adaptive collaborative systems, with run-time guarantees. To enable this, our focus is on requirement engineering and safety assurance techniques to capture the specific safety and security properties for the collaborative system, and to provide an assurance case guaranteeing that the system is sufficiently safe.

With the adoption of wireless communication and network techniques, train control systems are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Notably, the jamming attacks, aiming at the handoff process that is the weakest part of train ground communication systems, will cause long disruption of communication. It will have a severe impact on train control operation efficiency. Current research regarding industry control system security is hard to model the impact of the jamming attacks on the train control system quantitatively, and current countermeasure schemes against jamming attacks are not designed for the operating mechanism of train control systems. This paper first builds the train control security state transition probability model under jamming attacks. A cross-layer defense scheme is then proposed from the aspect of the physical layer, the cyber layer and the management layer. In the physical layer, this paper designs a model prediction control algorithm to track dynamic target signals, in the hopes of eventually tracking the dynamic target quickly and smoothly. In the cyber layer, a multi-stage and zero-sum stochastic game model is built for the channel selection for the attack and the defense, whereby the channel selection randomized policy will be obtained. In the management layer, a dynamic train travel speed profile generation algorithm is proposed to mitigate the jamming attacks’ impact on train control systems. Extensive simulation results are shown that jamming attack impact on CBTC can be mitigated effectively with our proposed cross-layer defense scheme.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3005931","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2018JBM076); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973026); Beijing Municipal Education Commission Funding(grant numbers:I20H100010,I19H100010); Beijing Science and Technology Commission Funding(grant numbers:Z191100010818001); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L181004); Project(grant numbers:RCS2019ZT010,RCS2018K008,2018JBZ002); Beijing Traffic Control Technology (BJTCT) Innovation Funding(grant numbers:9907006509); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142439","Communication-based train control (CBTC);security;cross-layer defense;stochastic game","Jamming;Games;Security;Control systems;Physical layer;Stochastic processes;Communication systems","jamming;mobility management (mobile radio);predictive control;railway communication;railway engineering;stochastic games;target tracking;telecommunication security;wireless channels","cross-layer defense methods;jamming-resistant CBTC systems;communication-based train control systems;jamming attacks;train ground communication systems;train control operation efficiency;train control security state transition probability model;cross-layer defense scheme;physical layer;cyber layer;management layer;model prediction control algorithm;dynamic train travel speed profile generation algorithm;industry control system security;handoff process;zero-sum stochastic game model","","37","","42","IEEE","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For each sampled scenario, an iterative dynamic scenario updating approach is introduced to consider interactions among covariate conditions, random component outages, and maintenance outage scheduling. The co-optimization problem is decoupled into three separate optimization subproblems by Lagrangian relaxation (LR), which include generation maintenance scheduling, transmission maintenance scheduling, and short-term SCUC problems. Each scenario is dynamically updated based on the optimal maintenance outage and SCUC solutions, and maintenance and SCUC solutions are re-optimized using the updated scenario. The iterative procedure stops when neither the optimal schedule nor the dynamic scenario changes any further.

Although regular expressions offer superior expressive ability and flexibility, application protocols are described by regular expression manually based on sufficiently understanding protocol itself. At present there is not an effect method to realize classification, recognition and control automatically for the known applications and the unknown applications in future. In this paper a novel approach is presented to model network application specification. In this work, the whole automatic protocol reverse engineering is realized through accomplishing the protocol state machine, and then the FSMs are translated to corresponding regular expressions to enrich and update the pattern database. This approach uses grammatical inference and is motivated by the observation that an implementation of the protocol is inherently a state transition process, the state machine model the essence exactly. The important significance is to describe various state protocols with a common method through modeling the protocol state transition, including known and unknown ones. This approach had been implemented in the system and evaluated using real-world implementations of three different protocols: HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and compared the extracted protocol to the corresponding other newly system, such as 17-filter.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319072","protocol reverse engineering;automaton inference;regular expression;Protocol analysis","Protocols;Automata;Reverse engineering;Context modeling;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control;Testing;Automatic control;Databases","finite state machines;formal specification;grammars;protocols;reverse engineering;telecommunication security","automatic network protocol automaton extraction;reverse engineering;communication session;protocol state machine;network security;intrusion prevention;intrusion detection;traffic normalization;penetration testing;protocol specification;regular expression;network application specification;FSM;pattern database;grammatical inference;HTTP;SMTP;FTP","","9","2","27","IEEE","10 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in such inherent low-inertia systems, randomness and fluctuation of the output power of RESs and uncertain load consumption can easily incur dynamic stability issues, such as transient power impact, unacceptable frequency deviations, and operation mode transitions for security. To solve the above problems and enhance the dynamic stability of the system, an enhanced dynamic stability control (EDSC) scheme with locally measured signals only is proposed in this paper. In this control scheme, the bi-directional interlinking dc-ac converter uses the ac frequency in ac MG as the reference value of dc voltage and adopts the current feedforward control to control the dc voltage in the dc MG to be consistent with the ac frequency. By electrically coupling dc voltage and ac frequency, power disturbances in ac or dc sides will cause almost identical variation degrees in both ac frequency and dc voltage. Under the proposed EDSC scheme, the distributed ESSs in both ac and dc sides are then automatically coordinated and controlled by the unified droop control to balance transient power disturbances and smooth output of diesel generator under normal condition, which can effectively improve stability and controllability of such low-inertia systems. Furthermore, in an emergency such as failure of diesel generator, the operation mode can be switched seamlessly with the proposed EDSC scheme. The detailed theoretical analysis including control system design, small signal model analysis of key parameter influence on system dynamics, and simulation verifications in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment is presented to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed EDSC scheme.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926814","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51807135); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8755829","Low-inertia hybrid ac/dc microgrids;distributed energy storage systems;enhanced dynamic stability control;transient power sharing;seamless transition","Generators;Power system stability;Frequency control;Voltage control;Transient analysis;Hybrid power systems;Stability analysis","control system synthesis;controllability;DC-AC power convertors;distributed power generation;electric current control;energy storage;feedforward;hybrid power systems;power generation control;power generation reliability;power system CAD;power system stability;renewable energy sources;voltage control","distributed energy storage systems;isolated remote areas;islands;power supply reliability;enhanced dynamic stability control scheme;bi-directional interlinking dc-ac converter;ac frequency;current feedforward control;EDSC scheme;distributed ESSs;unified droop control;transient power disturbances;controllability;system dynamics;diesel generators;dc voltage control;control system design;low-inertia hybrid ac-dc microgrid;renewable energy sources-based distributed generators;RES;uncertain load consumption;ac-dc MG;small signal model analysis;PSCAD-EMTDC environment","","43","","24","CCBY","5 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Occasional incidents may cause overload problems, voltage problems, and cascading failures. These problems may damage the system stability. Therefore, in the normal state of the system, it is important to study the state transition and its harm to the system through security analysis. Besides, adopting certain control measures to reduce the risk of the system, such as the coordination of prevention and emergency control, is of great significance to both the safety and the economy of the system. In this premise, this paper proposes a risk-based two-layer optimization model for coordination on prevention control and emergency control of quasi-steady state AC-DC system. By introducing a continuous derivable function, the non-derivable constraints in the traditional model are replaced by continuous derivable constraints.

As technology and grid infrastructure evolve to develop more advanced WAPAC applications, however, so do the attack surfaces in the grid infrastructure. This paper presents an attack-resilient system (ARS) for the WAPAC cybersecurity by seamlessly integrating the network intrusion detection system (NIDS) with intrusion mitigation and prevention system (IMPS). In particular, the proposed NIDS utilizes signature and behavior-based rules to detect attack reconnaissance, communication failure, and data integrity attacks. Further, the proposed IMPS applies state transition-based mitigation and prevention strategies to quickly restore the normal grid operation after cyberattacks. As a proof of concept, we validate the proposed generic architecture of ARS by performing experimental case study for wide-area protection scheme (WAPS), one of the critical WAPAC applications, and evaluate the proposed NIDS and IMPS components of ARS in a cyber-physical testbed environment. Our experimental results reveal a promising performance in detecting and mitigating different classes of cyberattacks while supporting an alert visualization dashboard to provide an accurate situational awareness in real-time.","","978-1-7281-8693-1","10.1109/RWS50334.2020.9241291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9241291","","Power system stability;Tools;Control systems;Real-time systems;Smart grids;Computer crime;Resilience","data integrity;energy management systems;power system control;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","intrusion mitigation;network intrusion detection system;WAPAC cybersecurity;attack-resilient system;attack surfaces;advanced WAPAC applications;grid infrastructure;system stability;wide-area communication network;energy management system;smart grid;control system;attack-resilient wide-area protection;critical WAPAC applications;wide-area protection scheme;normal grid operation;prevention strategies;state transition-based mitigation;data integrity attacks;attack reconnaissance;behavior-based rules;NIDS;prevention system","","3","","18","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The concept of resilience is introducing to measure the ability of the system to maintain its function under attack. It matters in evaluating the security of modern industrial systems. This paper presents a 3D Resilience State Space method to assess Communication-based train control (CBTC) system resilience under malware attack. We model the spread of malware as two functions: the communicability function $f$(x) and the susceptibility function 9 (x). We describe the characteristics of these two function in the CBTC complex network by using the percolation theory. Then we use a perturbation formalism to analyze the impact of malware attack on information flow and use it as an indicator of the cyber layer state. The CBTC cyber-physical system resilience metric formalizes as the system state transitions in three-dimensional state space. The three dimensions respectively represent the cyber layer state, the physical layer state, and the transmission layer state. The simulation results reveal that the proposed framework can effectively assess the resilience of the CBTC system.

SBP supersedes the prior IEEE Std 2410(TM)-2019 by including a formal specification for privacy and biometrics such that a conforming SBP system does not incur GDPR, CCPA, BIPA or HIPAA privacy obligations. Homomorphic encryption ensures the biometric payload is always one-way encrypted with no need for key management and provides full privacy by ensuring plaintext biometrics are never received by the SBP server. The SBP implementation includes software running on a client device and on the SPB server. Pluggable components are used to replace legacy functionality to allow rapid integration into existing operating environments. The SBP implementation allows the systems to meet security needs by using the application programming interface, whether the underlying system is a relational database management system or a search engine. The SBP implementation functionality offers a “point-and-cut” mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production systems as well as to the systems in development. The architecture is language neutral, allowing Representational State Transfer (REST ), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide the communication interface.

However, Ajax techniques that enable better web experiences also make it fairly challenging to model Ajax application behaviors in the complex browser environment. In Ajax applications, server-side states are no longer synchronous with the views to end users at the client side. Therefore, to model the behaviors of Ajax applications, it is indispensable to incorporate client-side application states into the behavior models, as being explored by prior work. Unfortunately, how to leverage behavior models to perform security diagnosis in Ajax applications has yet been thoroughly examined. Existing models extracted from Ajax application behaviors are insufficient in a security context. In this paper, we propose a new behavior model for diagnosing attacks in Ajax applications, which abstracts both client-side state transitions as well as their communications to external servers. Our model articulates different states with the browser events or user actions that trigger state transitions. With a prototype implementation, we demonstrate that the proposed model is effective in attack diagnosis for real-world Ajax applications.","","978-0-7695-5007-7","10.1109/ICECCS.2013.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6601822","","Electronic mail;Browsers;Security;Context;Web servers;Load modeling","Internet;online front-ends;security of data","comprehensive client-side behavior model;real-world Ajax applications;complex Web-based systems;complex browser environment;security incident diagnosis;external servers;browser events;user actions;state transitions;prototype implementation;attack diagnosis","","9","","41","IEEE","19 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current methods for detecting attacks are not sufficiently accurate and no methods can provide attack mitigation. To ensure vehicle ABS security, we propose an attack detection method to accurately detect both sensor attack and CAN bus attack in a vehicle ABS, and an attack mitigation strategy to mitigate their negative effects on the vehicle ABS. In our attack detection method, we build a vehicle state space equation which considers real-time road friction coefficient to predict vehicle states (i.e., wheel speed and longitudinal brake force) with their previous values. Based on sets of historical measured vehicle states, we develop a search algorithm to find out attack changes (vehicle state changes because of the attack) by minimizing errors between predicted vehicle states and measured vehicle states. In our attack mitigation strategy, attack changes are subtracted from measured vehicle states to generate correct vehicle states for the vehicle ABS. We conducted first real sensor attack experiments to show how a magnet affects sensor readings. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack detection method can detect sensor attack and CAN bus attack more accurately compared with existing methods, and also our attack mitigation strategy almost eliminates attack's effects on the vehicle ABS.","2637-9430","978-1-7281-6607-0","10.1109/ICCCN49398.2020.9209645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9209645","CAN bus attack;Sensor attack;Attack detection and mitigation;Vehicle ABS","Brakes;Force;Wheels;Hydraulic systems;Real-time systems;Roads;Friction","brakes;braking;controller area networks;field buses;search problems;sensors","vehicle state prediction;attack mitigation strategy;sensor attack experiments;attack detection method;CAN bus attacks;controller area network bus;vehicle ABS security;vehicle state space equation;vehicle antilock braking systems;driving direction control;real-time road friction coefficient;search algorithm","","2","","24","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To resist the DoS attacks, a new construction algorithm of the k-connected communication topology is developed based on the proposed necessary and sufficient criteria of the k-connected graph. Furthermore, combined with the k-connected topology, a distributed event-triggered controller is designed to guarantee the consensus of CPSs under mode-switching DoS (MSDoS) attacks. Different from the existing distributed control schemes, a new technology, that is, the extended Laplacian matrix method, is combined to design the distributed controller independent on the knowledge and the dwell time of DoS attack modes. Finally, the simulation example illustrates the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed construction algorithm and a distributed control scheme.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2020.2973303","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61773097,U1813214); LiaoNing Revitalization Talents Program(grant numbers:XLYC1907035); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016368","Cyber-physical systems;denial-of-service (DoS) attacks;distributed control;k-connected graph","Topology;Laplace equations;Denial-of-service attack;Cyber-physical systems;Decentralized control;Cyberattack;Communication channels","computer network security;distributed control;graph theory;telecommunication control;telecommunication network topology","distributed secure control;denial-of-service attacks;cyber-physical systems;k-connected communication topology;security problem;CPSs;construction algorithm;distributed event-triggered controller;mode-switching DoS attacks;distributed control schemes;distributed controller independent;DoS attack modes;k-connected graph","","36","","37","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This type of storage has several issues, such as privacy and data integrity, because several parties will fully regulate privacy and data integrity. Therefore, a data storage system is needed that can provide privacy, security, and data integrity to maintain the authenticity of sensitive data. This study wants to develop to implement blockchain technology to store employee attendance data from the HR department in a company. Employee attendance data is taken from the Angular web application integrated with a permissioned blockchain framework called Hyperledger Composer. This study chose Hyperledger Composer because this type of blockchain has a fast validation time. Hyperledger Composer has a Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API) named composer-rest-server, which allows Hyperledger blockchain to interact with other components. The implementation results show that Hyperledger Composer can be functionally used as data storage for the attendance management and Payroll system. In addition, Hyperledger Composer performance is measured by evaluating block transaction times. The evaluation of the Hyperledger Composer is done in three ways: directly within the Hyperledger Composer, using the Angular web application through the REST API, and using JMeter through the REST API. As a result, testing for making transaction blocks varies from 1 - 17ms on an experiment directly in Hyperledger Composer, 5 - 296ms through the REST API using JMeter tools, and 1 - 4270ms through the Angular Web Application. The result shows that the performance of the REST API produced by the composer-rest-server is recorded faster than Ethereum. With these results, composer-rest-server can handle systems that require fast transaction times, such as voting systems, health monitoring, and the Internet of Things (IoT) application, because the average time to conduct transactions is still under one second. Thus, Hyperledger as attendance data storage can provide privacy and data integrity.","2642-6102","978-1-6654-6658-5","10.1109/TENSYMP54529.2022.9864383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9864383","blockchain;Hyperledger;composer-rest-server;attendance;REST API","Data privacy;Distributed ledger;Data integrity;Memory;Companies;Blockchains;Representational state transfer","application program interfaces;data integrity;data privacy;human resource management;Internet;payroll data processing;transaction processing;Web services","blockchain-based attendance management;payroll system;data integrity;data storage system;employee attendance data;Angular web application;representational state transfer application programming interface;REST API;hyperledger blockchain;hyperledger composer;attendance data storage;block transaction times;JMeter;data privacy;time 1.0 ms to 17.0 ms;time 5.0 ms to 296.0 ms;time 1.0 ms to 4270.0 ms","","","","13","IEEE","29 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems are commonly used for the security purposes but are increasingly being used in a variety of other applications such as residential security, voter verification, banking using ATM. Changes in facial expression become a difficult task in recognizing faces. In this paper continuous naturalistic affective expressions will be recognized using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. Active Appearance Model (AAM) landmarks are considered for each frame of the videos. The AAMs were used to track the face and extract its visual features. There are six different facial expressions considered over here: Happy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Fear and Sad. Different Expression recognition problem is solved through a multistage automatic pattern recognition system where the temporal relationships are modeled through the HMM framework. Dimension levels (i.e., labels) can be defined as the hidden states sequences in the HMM framework. Then the probabilities of these hidden states and their state transitions can be accurately computed from the labels of the training set. Through a three stage classification approach, the output of a first-stage classification is used as observation sequences for a second stage classification, modeled as a HMM-based framework. The k-NN will be used for the first stage classification. A third classification stage, a decision fusion tool, is then used to boost overall performance.","","978-1-4799-2320-5","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892800","Hidden Markov model (HMM);K Nearest Neighbor (k-NN);Active Appearance Model (AAM);Dimension levels","Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Face recognition;Speech recognition;Active appearance model;Support vector machine classification;Speech","biometrics (access control);face recognition;hidden Markov models","hidden states;state transitions;AAM landmarks;active appearance model;HMM framework;ATM;banking;voter verification;residential security;digital image;biometric software application;Hidden Markov Model;automatic human facial expression recognition","","5","","23","IEEE","8 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The limited power point tracking refers to controlling the power output of a photovoltaic array at a level below the maximum power point. The limited power point tracking exhibits advantages over maximum power point tracking (MPPT) both in terms of economy and system security. The previously reported LPPT methods, however, exhibit more oscillations at low power levels or require additional mode changing action under power scarcity and may malfunction under the rapidly varying environmental conditions. To avoid those difficulties, two novel LPPT control schemes are proposed. Both the schemes are carefully designed with minimum deviation from the traditional MPPT control so as to ensure easy implementation. Each of the controllers proposed has its own merit. The LPPT control under the proposed schemes can be implemented without the support of any local energy storage. Detailed case studies are performed to verify the effectiveness of proposed LPPT controllers.","","978-1-5090-3892-3","10.1109/CICPS.2015.7974075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7974075","Incremental conductance method;limited power point tracking;maximum power point tracking;perturb and observe method;photovoltaic system","Photovoltaic systems;Voltage control;Maximum power point trackers;Generators;Convergence;Oscillators","maximum power point trackers;photovoltaic power systems;power system economics;power system security;voltage control","photovoltaic plant;voltage-controlled DC bus;limited power point tracking;LPPT methods;photovoltaic array;maximum power point tracking;MPPT;power system economy;power system security","","5","","14","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite this, the access control management remains a challenge, once managing security policies involves dealing with a large set of access control rules, detecting conflicting policies, defining priorities, delegating rights, and reacting against network state changes and events. This work presents the HACFlow, a novel, autonomic, and policy-based framework for access control management in OpenFlow networks. HACFlow aims to simplify and automate the network management allowing network operators to govern rights of network entities by defining dynamic, fine-grained, and high-level access control policies.

Specifically, false data injection attacks aim at tampering with the sensed data that reflect the normal system operation state. Therefore, a time-efficient and accurate approach to assessing sensor trustworthiness is necessary. To this end, we propose T-LHDM (a trust model based on low and high decision-making processes), a sensor state trust model based on a Markov chain to represent sensor state transitions in normal operating conditions. To demonstrate the model, we first observed sensed data in a hierarchical decision-making process by intentionally exploiting the sensor data’s temporal and spatial correlations. Then, the consistency between the precomputed set of sensor state transitions and the observed ones was used to detect corruptions and assess the sensor trustworthiness. Our experiments using two real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed model accurately assessed the sensor trustworthiness with an average accuracy of 95%. We also stress the significance of considering the sensor’s spatiotemporal correlations to assess the trust of the sensed data, which has been neglected in previous studies. To this end, we conducted a comparative evaluation against a contemporary temporal correlation-based method and three well-known correlation tests. The results showed that T-LHDM outperformed all the competing methods.","2641-810X","978-1-6654-7402-3","10.1109/EDCC57035.2022.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9933141","Sensor correlations;False data attack;IoT","Correlation;Systems operation;Decision making;Markov processes;Data models;Spatial databases;Spatiotemporal phenomena","computer crime;decision making;Internet of Things;Markov processes;security of data;telecommunication security","sensed data;contemporary temporal correlation-based method;trust assessment model;hierarchical decision-making process;IoT sensor networks;IoT devices;false data injection attacks;normal system operation state;low decision-making processes;high decision-making processes;sensor state trust model;sensor state transitions;sensor data;T-LHDM;Markov chain;real-world datasets","","","","27","IEEE","2 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the associated goals of an ultimate quality-of-service (QoS) that support real-time and mission-critical applications, along with utmost security and reliability, remain elusive. This paper describes a fundamental technological advance that not only attains ideal QoS with unique security and reliability capabilities but also supports full interworking with traditional IP networks, inasmuch as it does not require modification (e.g., labeling) or higher-layer/proprietary interpretation of IP packets. We describe an advanced wide-area network composed of traditional end-points, dual-mode switch/routers, and sequencing agents that provide per-flow admission and scheduling of packets on a link-by-link basis from source to destination. The network is fully scalable and can readily provide reachability across multiple domains that span the globe. Sequencing agents assure an individual, time-deterministic path for every critical application-i.e., those that require minimal transport delay (i.e., no packet queueing), no jitter and no packet loss. Moreover, since sequencing is accomplished on a per-flow basis and invokes a temporal paradigm for packet switching, we show that applications are completely immune to extraneous network influences, notably network congestion or Denial-of-Service attacks. As discussed in this paper, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment realization has demonstrated these attributes for both customary realtime flows (examples of which include voice- and video-over-IP) and sequenced TCP flows. The latter is especially significant, in that it makes possible for the first time a system for fully managed and guaranteed throughput of TCP data while maximizing goodput, a significant advance for reliable, deterministic, secure data transmission and networked storage. This paper further makes clear that traditional end-points (e.g., videoconferencing units and IP phones) can readily operate in packet-sequenced networks. Moreover, we note that the sequencing protocol permits per-flow reuse of preallocated-but unused-throughput. Consequently, nonsequenced packets (e.g., best-effort, asynchronous data) are ""backfilled"" and amenable to conventional routing in either sequenced networks or interconnected, conventional IP networks, thereby providing facile interworking with the large embedded base of legacy IP equipment.","","0-7803-8140-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290287","","Wide area networks;Packet switching;IP networks;Switches;Web and internet services;Quality of service;Mission critical systems;Data security;Labeling;Delay","IP networks;packet switching;transport protocols;computer network management;computer network reliability;Internet;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;quality of service","Internet;converged IP infrastructure;quality-of-service;QoS;reliability;wide-area network;WAN;dual-mode switch;routers;packet switching;network congestion;denial-of-service;commercial-off-the-shelf;COTS equipment;TCP flows;secure data transmission;packet-sequenced networks;sequencing protocol","","1","","7","IEEE","4 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Bell-LaPadula Model (abbreviated BLP) is a state machine model used for enforcing access control, while it can't be used for networks. L-BLP model is designed for Local Area Networks(LAN) while it can't be proved security. We reveal the security problems in L-BLP and propose a security model based on BLP. We define five new state transition rules, which are designed for LAN with high usability. Our model can be proved to be secure in mathematics, and we implement a prototype system based from it.

Users can access application servers in MEC instead of routing to the internet by passing through a core cellular network. Few security challenges arise as the traffic does not traverse through the core network, and these can be solved by providing authentication services in the MEC. However, authentication and application mobility issues arise in the case of multiple MECs where a user is mobile and needs continuous service from application servers, without needing to establish a new session and providing authentication information repeatedly to every new MEC the user connects with. In this work, with improved survey, real-time cellular network testbed deployment, more results, and detailed security analysis., we propose two solutions, a TC3A (Token-based Cookie transfer & 3rd-party Authentication) and a TS3A (Token-based State transfer & 3rd-party Authentication) for resolution of authentication and application mobility issues while achieving low latency. We conducted experiments on a testbed that had MECs deployed in a real-time cellular network (emulated via OpenAirInterface) and performed user handover between two MECs. The experimental results show that TC3A and TS3A successfully re-authenticate the users, without provision of login credentials with target MEC, while reducing the latency by approximately 49.76–59.72% as compared to simple login method. The TC3A and TS3A also eliminate the need of keeping multiple accounts for applications at different MECs and most importantly provide application service continuity, through state transfer during cross-system handover, which is not provided by a simple login method. TC3A provides the application service continuity without any loss of session state, which is suitable for applications that cannot afford state loss, and TS3A provides the same while reducing the latency by 47.05–51.25% as compared to TC3A, which is suitable for applications that require low latency.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2023.3296085","H2020 EU-TW 5G-Coral; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10185455","Mobile Edge Computing;Multi-Access Edge Computing;Authentication;Mobility;Latency;3GPP Cellular Networks","Authentication;Servers;Low latency communication;Security;Cellular networks;5G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A distinction between left pectoral unipolar and bipolar pacemaker electrodes has been made here. Furthermore the different positions of a bipolar electrode were taken into consideration. It was found that depending on the position of the bipolar electrodes in a homogeneous magnetic field, major differences of induced voltage occur. The main task of this project is to ascertain the influence of electric conductivity on interference voltage in bipolar electrodes. The measurement circuit has been placed into an original pacemaker case and therefore allowed the comparison between bipolar and unipolar electrodes by only mode switching. The magnetic field has been generated by a Helmholtz coil. Part of the Helmholtz coil system was a model of a human torso filled with saline solution to simulate human tissue. The result of the measurements showed a dependency between electric conductivity and induced voltage. The extensively discussed security factor of bipolar electrodes could be calculated from the above-mentioned measurements. The assumed transition in interference voltage from bipolar to unipolar electrodes at about 100 kHz has been significantly lower in these experiments.","2325-0364","978-1-4244-2737-6","10.1109/EMCEUROPE.2008.4786875","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4786875","pacemaker;magnetic field;interferenc voltage;bipolar electrode;security factor","Interference;Voltage;Implantable biomedical devices;Biomedical electrodes;Magnetic field measurement;Pacemakers;Magnetic fields;Conductivity;Coils;Humans","biomedical electrodes;electrical conductivity;interference (signal);magnetic fields;pacemakers","interference voltage;implantable medical devices;bipolar pacemaker electrodes;unipolar electrodes;security factor;magnetic fields;electric conductivity;mode switching;Helmholtz coil;frequency 10 kHz to 30 kHz","","5","","5","IEEE","24 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, blockchain technology has been introduced as a panacea to our security problems, including that of authentication, without sufficient reasoning, as to its merits.In this work, we investigate the merits of using open distributed ledgers (ODLs), such as the one implemented by blockchain technology, for securing TM systems for authentication. We formally model such systems, and explore how blockchain can help mitigate attacks against them. After formal argumentation, we conclude that in the context of Trust Management for authentication, blockchain technology, and ODLs in general, can offer considerable advantages compared to previous approaches. Our analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to formally model and argue about the security of TM systems for authentication, based on blockchain technology. To achieve this result, we first provide an abstract model for TM systems for authentication. Then, we show how this model can be conceptually encoded in a blockchain, by expressing it as a series of state transitions. As a next step, we examine five prevalent attacks on TM systems, and provide evidence that blockchain-based solutions can be beneficial to the security of such systems, by mitigating, or completely negating such attacks.","2324-9013","978-1-5090-4906-6","10.1109/Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS.2017.283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029486","Trust Management for authentication;blockchain technology;formal modeling;attacks and defences","Authentication;Public key;Electronic mail;Bitcoin;Organizations","interactive systems;trusted computing;ubiquitous computing","trust management;authentication;TM systems;online interactions security;ubiquitous system;Web of Trust;blockchain technology;open distributed ledgers;ODL","","43","1","50","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electric power dispatch systems, management information systems, customer relation systems and so on, are all built on this infrastructure. It is an important task for network administrators of electric power industry to monitor, control and manage electric power information networks. Through installing safeguards, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and anti-virus systems, the reliability of Electric Power Information Networks has been improved to a certain extent. However, threats also exist due to the loss of comprehensive understanding about network vulnerability. System methods should be employed to the vulnerability research of electric power information networks. Modeling Electric Power Information Network vulnerability and finding network flaws become more and more critical. A network intruder will take a series of actions to achieve a certain goal, and each action will change the state of a network. Thereby attack trees can be used to model the vulnerability of a network. An attack tree can be viewed as a directed tree where vertices represent network states and edges represent actions that lead state transitions. Root vertex is a certain goal. Any path from a leaf vertex to the root vertex is a whole attack pattern violating the security property of a network. A node of an attack tree can be decomposed as a set of attack sub-goals, either all of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed, or any one of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed. So there are two decomposition operations in an attack tree: AND and OR. Formal logic can be applied to attack analysis. Thus we can model attacks for network vulnerability analysis. This modeling method has two major advantages. At first it can be used to analyze the flaws of a network and find unknown flaws. Secondly network administrators use it to handle flaws rationally under the limits of the finite resources. Electric power information networks are generally made up of production control networks, enterprise management networks and external networks. They are connected and form a complex network. It is necessary to comprehend and analyze its vulnerability. An information network of an electric power plant is illustrated, and attack modeling is used to analyze its vulnerability. Industry control computers can manipulate electric devices. It is vital to guarantee industry control computers. Hence the goal is set to obtain the administrator right of an industry control computer. An attack tree is constructed tolocate the flaws of the network. Some advices to network security administrators are given. It is an attempt to formulate the security administration of electric power information networks using attack trees. Faulty Tree Method (FTM) has been used to analysis the reliability of power systems. Attack tree can help integrate the reliability analysis of the hybrid system consisting of an electric power system and an electric power information network system.","","978-1-4244-5940-7","10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5666152","Electric power information network;attack tree;vulnerability;network security","Servers;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Analytical models;Security;Fires","directed graphs;fault trees;formal logic;load dispatching;power system reliability;power system simulation;security of data;trees (mathematics)","electric power information networks;attack modeling;electric power system;electric power dispatch system;management information system;customer relation system;safeguard;directed tree;root vertex;formal logic;network vulnerability analysis;enterprise management networks;production control networks;industry control computer;network security administrators;faulty tree method;FTM;power system reliability;power system analysis","","","","15","IEEE","13 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the present paper, we develop a framework for the formal verification of grsecurity, an access control system developed on top of Unix/Linux systems. The verification problem in grsecurity presents much of the complexity of modern RBAC systems, due to the presence of policy state changes that may arise both from explicit administrative primitives supported by grsecurity, and as the result of the interaction with the underlying operating system facilities. We develop a formal semantics for grsecurity's RBAC system, based on a labelled transition system, and a sound abstraction of that semantics providing a bounded approximation, amenable to model checking.

This new approach solves the communication reliability problems and addresses application security. This paper is a case study of 3 installed DTT systems that use cellular communication - one system at Central Virginia Electric Cooperative and two at Dominion Energy. In this paper the authors will report on the design, implementation, performance and issues encountered during and post project execution. These intelligent DTT systems have been designed to increase availability of the DG by preventing the indiscriminate disconnection of the sites. Traditionally Direct Transfer Trip Signals (DTT) has been sent between substations and remote Distributed Generation (DG) sites using leased telephone lines. If DTT communication is interrupted, the DTT system will disconnect the DG site. Leased copper lines are becoming less reliable, leading to unwanted disconnection of DG sites. Installation of fiber is not always feasible due to the cost. This paper will discuss an approach to provide DTT signals using wireless communications. The paper will address the security concerns that many Utilities might face. Two new innovations to increase the DG site's availability will be discussed. 1) Automatic Direct Transfer Close If system conditions return to normal after a DTT event, the system will automatically close the DG site back in onto the feeder. 2) Dynamic Feeder State change protection function. Using cellular or wireless communication systems it must be expected that there will be communication interruptions during normal maintenance actions. During these times the DG site device activates a new protection function that will detect any anomalies that could constitute a change in the connected feeder systems (e.g. caused by a fault or the opening of a breaker) and then only disconnect the DG site.","2474-9753","978-1-7281-4019-3","10.1109/CPRE.2019.8765861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765861","","Substations;Reliability;Optical fiber communication;Optical fiber devices;Telephone sets;Wireless communication;Circuit faults","cellular radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","dynamic feeder state change protection function;automatic direct transfer;distributed generation;substations;intelligent direct transfer trip signal;Dominion Energy;intelligent DTT signal system;remote distributed generation sites;copper lines;telephone lines;communication reliability problems;connected feeder systems;DG site device;wireless communication systems;cellular communication systems;DTT communication;Central Virginia Electric Cooperative","","2","","2","IEEE","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The unconventional paradigm shift needed is justified by showing that conventional, minimalism-based, FSM synthesis and encodings allow direct correlation between state/transitions and Hamming Models. A two-fold method, involving structural modifications and specific encoding strategies, is proposed for side-channel secure FSM (S*FSMs).

In this paper, we present a boundary-based access control model incorporating an advanced security mechanism, in order to support fine-grained authorizations in the right time for the provision of services, based on the analysis of system boundary. In this model, access permissions are controlled by the state transitions at different layers including workflow layers, control layers and data layers. The access control mechanism is based on an RBAC model, which incorporates dynamic context information. Context is classified based on the analysis of system boundary into six main categories, which is further categorized as simple condition and composite condition, thus forming a multi-level context. In a multi-level hierarchy of context conditions, the access control model is implemented dynamically, by checking the context constraint associated with each access task at the time of the specific request submission, whose functionality and the constituent parts have been described formally and in detail.","","978-0-7695-3600-2","10.1109/IFITA.2009.274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5232219","system boundary;access control;multi-level context","Access control;Authorization;Permission;Protection;Context modeling;Information technology;Information management;Shipbuilding industry;Data security;Information security","authorisation","boundary-based access control model;sensitive information protection;information management;advanced security mechanism;fine-grained authorization;workflow layers;control layers;data layers;RBAC model","","","","6","IEEE","4 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, integration of intelligence and cyber systems into a power grid can lead to serious cyber security challenges and makes the overall system more vulnerable to cyber attacks. To address this challenging issue, this article presents defense mechanisms to either protect the system from attackers in advance or detect the existence of data injection attacks to improve the smart grid security. Focusing on signal processing techniques, this article introduces an adaptive scheme on detection of injected bad data at the control center. This scheme takes the power measurements of two sequential data collection slots into account, and detects data injection attacks by monitoring the measurement variations and state changes between the two time slots. The proposed scheme has the capability of adaptively detecting attacks including both non-stealthy attacks and stealthy attacks. Stealthy attacks are proved impossible to detect using conventional residual- based methods, and can cause more dangerous effects on power systems than non-stealthy attacks. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can also be used for attack classification to help system operators prioritize their actions to better protect their systems, and is therefore very valuable in practical smart grid systems.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067689","","Transmission line measurements;Power measurement;Smart grids;Power transmission lines;Sensors;State estimation;Energy management;Internet of Things;Information exchange","energy conservation;energy consumption;power engineering computing;power measurement;power system measurement;power system security;security of data;signal processing;smart power grids","stealthy attacks;power systems;nonstealthy attacks;attack classification;system operators;defense mechanisms;data injection attacks;smart grid networks;intelligence;cyber systems;power grid;smart grid security;injected bad data;sequential data collection slots;bidirectional information exchange;energy consumption;energy efficiency;cyber security challenges;signal processing;control center;power measurements;measurement variations","","33","","15","IEEE","13 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

By introducing the maximum entropy (MaxENT) models into the rule optimization for the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model, this paper proposes an improved BLP model with the self-learning function: MaxENT-BLP. This model first formalizes the security properties, system states, transformational rules, and a constraint model based on the states transition of the MaxENT. After handling the historical system access logs as the original data sets, this model extracts the user requests, current states, and decisions to act as the feature vectors. Second, we use k -fold cross validation to divide all vectors into a training set and a testing set. In this paper, the model training process is based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. And this model contains a strategy update algorithm to adjust the access control rules dynamically according to the access and decision records in a system. Third, we prove that MaxENT-BLP is secure through theoretical analysis. By estimating the precision, recall, and F1-score, the experiments show the availability and accuracy of this model. Finally, this paper provides the process of model training based on deep learning and discussions regarding adversarial samples from the malware classifiers.

Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hashing Algorithm 1 (SHA1) encryption are algorithms that are often used in this case. This study aims to examine the performance of the two algorithms. The Wireshark application is used to retrieve authentication data. Authentication data is still encrypted, then tested by Brute Force Attack using Hashcat tools. In addition, each algorithm is measured in terms of the time needed for the REST API Authentication process, which uses the Postman application. Based on Brute Force Attack testing the SHA1 encryption algorithm has the advantage of being stronger, but the time needed for encryption is slower when compared to the MD5 algorithm. Even though it's more tethered, the difference in encryption time needed is only 37.1 ms, so that SHA1 is still considered relevant for implementing security systems and REST API authentication on a mobile application.","","978-1-7281-1655-6","10.1109/ICOIACT46704.2019.8938570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8938570","Authentication;MD5;Mobile Data Security;Rest API;SHA1","Authentication;Encryption;Servers;Force;Testing","application program interfaces;client-server systems;cryptography;message authentication","authentication data;Brute Force Attack;REST API Authentication process;Postman application;SHA1 encryption algorithm;MD5 algorithm;encryption time;security systems;mobile application;SHA1 algorithms;mobile-based Application;mobile-based applications;client-server system;encryption methods;wireshark application;representational state transfer API authentication;Client-Server system;encrypt REST API authentication;time 37.1 ms","","1","","17","IEEE","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There exist a manifold of different reasons for system failures of devices starting from short-circuits, hardware defects or malware infections reaching to power shortages or complete blackouts. Moreover, the increase of the number of devices within the airport infrastructure system leads to a tremendous demand of computational assistance systems for operations management. As most devices within the airport are directly connected to processes, there is a high demand for identifying and managing system failures immediately and increase the system resilience. Thus, we introduce process-oriented-grouping of network devices and use linear algebra to relate the impact of system state changes to airport processes, such as check-in, security checks et cetera. This connection between system state and processes is inevitable for a successful combination of computational approaches to determine physical state variations, induced by power grid instabilities and/or cyber-attacks, and process oriented simulation methods. Matrix relations between system states, process capacities, waiting times are given and applied to a small, at this state fictional airport infrastructure. This application shows that forecasting of quantitative values for airport processes is a beneficial tool for airport infrastructure management. Moreover, linear algebra properties prove to be a strong tool in analyzing network properties, such as infrastructure diversity and process capacities, which play a major role within resource management. However, at the moment our approach is only suitable as a supporting tool for human decision making.

Several protocols and security mechanisms have been proposed to ensure primary security features such as confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non repudiation. However, ensuring the correctness of these protocols is crucial in ensuring user confidence in system security. Therefore, these protocols need to be verified in some formal sense that involves an exhaustive examination of the protocol flow and its state transitions.

With this model, the high integrity processes of a system are first measured and verified, and these processes are then protected from accesses initiated by low integrity processes. Toward dynamic systems with frequently changed system states, our framework verifies the latest state changes of a target system instead of considering the entire system information.

However, the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant strategies for CGRAs apply either temporal or spatial scheme, including redundancy, periodic detection, workload balancing, and reconfiguration, failing to exploit the feature of dynamic and partial reconfiguration of CGRAs. Also, vulnerable judging circuits and inflexible mode shifting bottleneck the reliability design of fault-tolerant CGRAs. This paper proposes a novel multi-mode fault-tolerant framework for CGRAs, which combines spatial-redundant data-paths with temporal-redundant voters and thus reduces the vulnerable judging circuits while balancing the performance and reliability. This framework can also enable a changing reliability level at runtime via an online configuration transformation method based on pre-compiled patterns. Within the proposed framework, we systematically searched the design space spanning various combinations of the mainstream schemes with a Markov process model to compare the effectiveness and accordingly selected five points as available modes in our design after comprehensive consideration of fault tolerance and time overhead on CGRA. The framework is comprehensively evaluated on a cycle-accurate CGRA simulator, considering both permanent and transient faults. The experimental results show that the fault coverage rate of single transient faults or permanent faults has increased from 71.74% to 93.84%, which means the fault tolerance of the system has been increased by 31.03% compared with the state-of-the-art methods. There is also a great improvement in mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) and reconfiguration latency over baseline designs.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2023.3239563","2022-XXXX-ZD-005-00(grant numbers:2022-XXXX-ZD-005-00); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61834002); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3100903); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025362","CGRA;dynamic compilation;TMR;reliability;fault-tolerant design","Fault tolerant systems;Redundancy;Circuit faults;Reliability;Reliability engineering;Detectors;Field programmable gate arrays","","","","","","","IEEE","24 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To bypass the network security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements. Experiment results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practice. Besides, MimicHunter is flexible in deployment and can be easily implemented in passive detection systems with only a little cost compared with the active methods.","","978-1-4673-7952-6","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345292","protocol mimicry;intrusion detection;evasive attack;protocol structure;state transition","Protocols;MIMICs;Payloads;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Malware","security of data","MimicHunter framework;passive network protocol mimicry detection framework;network based intrusion;information theft events;network security devices;firewall;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;IDS-IPS;Web application firewall;evasive techniques;network security audit","","1","","31","IEEE","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the framework's release, Noise-based protocols have been adopted by WhatsApp, WireGuard and other high-profile applications. We present Noise Explorer, an online engine for designing, reasoning about, formally verifying and implementing arbitrary Noise Handshake Patterns. Based on our formal treatment of the Noise Protocol Framework, Noise Explorer can validate any Noise Handshake Pattern and then translate it into a model ready for automated verification and also into a production-ready software implementation written in Go or in Rust. We use Noise Explorer to analyze more than 57 handshake patterns. We confirm the stated security goals for 12 fundamental patterns and provide precise properties for the rest. We also analyze unsafe handshake patterns and document weaknesses that occur when validity rules are not followed. All of this work is consolidated into a usable online tool that presents a compendium of results and can parse formal verification results to generate detailed-but-pedagogical reports regarding the exact security goals of each message of a Noise Handshake Pattern with respect to each party, under an active attacker and including malicious principals.

DIFUZZRTL develops a register-coverage guided fuzzing technique, which efficiently yet correctly identifies a state transition in the finite state machine of RTL designs. DIFUZZRTL also develops several new techniques in consideration of unique RTL design characteristics, including cycle-sensitive register coverage guiding, asynchronous interrupt events handling, a unified CPU input format with Tilelink protocols, and drop-in-replacement designs to support various CPU RTLs. We implemented DIFUZZRTL, and performed the evaluation with three real-world open source CPU RTLs: OpenRISC Mor1kx Cappuccino, RISC-V Rocket Core, and RISC-V Boom Core. During the evaluation, DIFUZZRTL identified 16 new bugs from these CPU RTLs, all of which were confirmed by the respective development communities and vendors.

The only proper way to protect a smart contract is to fix potential risks in its code before it is deployed to the blockchain. However, existing tools for smart contract security analysis focus on the detection of bugs but seldom consider the code fix issues. Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to understand and fix flawed code manually. In this paper we propose SMARTSHIELD, a bytecode rectification system, to fix three typical security-related bugs (i.e., state changes after external calls, missing checks for out-of-bound arithmetic operations, and missing checks for failing external calls) in smart contracts automatically and help developers release secure contracts. Moreover, SMARTSHIELD guarantees that the rectified contract is not only immune to certain attacks but also gas-friendly (i.e., a slightly increase of gas cost). To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of SMARTSHIELD, we applied it to 28,621 real-world buggy contracts on Ethereum blockchain (as of January 2nd2019). Experiment results demonstrated that among 95,502 insecure cases in those contracts, 87,346 (91.5%) of them were automatically fixed by SMARTSHIELD. A following test with both program analysis and real-world exploits further testified that the rectified contracts were secure against common attacks. Moreover, the rectification only introduced a 0.2 % gas increment for each contract on average.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-5143-4","10.1109/SANER48275.2020.9054825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9054825","Ethereum blockchain;Smart contract;Automated bug fix;Bytecode rectification","Codes;Costs;Smart contracts;Computer bugs;Semantics;Transforms;Software","contracts;cryptography;distributed databases;program debugging","security response mechanisms;smart contract security analysis;Ethereum blockchain;real-world buggy contracts;rectified contract;secure contracts;security-related bugs;bytecode rectification system;flawed code;code fix issues;code patching;automatic smart contract protection;SMARTSHIELD","","25","","68","IEEE","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior works require multiple access points (AP) deployed in the tracking region or to utilize elaborately selected multipaths in an indoor environment to achieve tracking. However, this prevents their wide adoption because scenarios like homes typically only have a single AP, and using multipaths is vulnerable to unexpected interferences due to the complex indoor environment. This paper proposes a tracking system using only a single AP. The insight behind the proposed system is to mine the multi-dimensional channel parameters from the direct path to realize tracking. Therefore, we develop a model that establishes the correlation between the target motion and channel parameters, including the direct path's angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD). Then, we can formulate the tracking problem as the state transition with the observations. Since the nonlinear observation equation, we use particle filters to solve the problem accurately. Finally, we validate the proposed system via simulation using ray-tracing software. The simulation results show that the median tracking error is 0.21 m based on a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), comparable to previous state-of-the-art systems.","2166-9589","978-1-6654-8053-6","10.1109/PIMRC54779.2022.9977459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9977459","Indoor tracking;single access point;wireless channel model;direct path;particle filter","Wireless communication;Target tracking;Simulation;Ray tracing;Mathematical models;Software;Indoor environment","direction-of-arrival estimation;image motion analysis;indoor radio;Kalman filters;multipath channels;particle filtering (numerical methods);radiowave propagation;ray tracing;target tracking;tracking;wireless LAN","complex indoor environment;decimeter level indoor tracking;direct path;elaborately selected multipaths;elderly care;median tracking error;multidimensional channel parameters;multiple access points;noise figure 20.0 dB;nonlinear observation equation;previous state-of-the-art systems;security monitoring;single access point;single AP;size 0.21 m;target motion;tracking problem;tracking region;tracking system;unexpected interferences","","","","10","IEEE","20 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There may be many Internet protocols for service access standards that are used to ensure interoperability between users browser and Web server, such as Representational State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Each service has its specific characteristics such as authentication and security requirements. Hence, Cloud providers attempt to lock customers into proprietary interfaces so consumers can find themselves at not expects inevitable vendor lock-in. Therefore, the focus of our paper is to propose a solution to this problem by using Cloud intermediate between Cloud providers and consumer in heterogeneous Cloud environments interfaces. This is to achieve benefits such as standardization and interoperability, minimizing lock-in of Cloud providers. To reach such benefits, we propose a Cloud SaaS based on two interfaces and an internet component. These interfaces are used in Cloud Consumer and Provider sides and therefore guarantee communication between Cloud Consumer and Provider using different Internet protocols for Web service access such as REST and SOAP.

Different mitigation techniques have been proposed in the literature that aims to mitigate these attacks by randomizing the address to cache location mappings. The security guarantees in these schemes are based on the degree of difficulty for an attacker to reliably determine the cache lines accessed by the victim within practical time settings. However, prior attacks have shown that newer and more improved algorithms can be envisaged that discover conflicting sets in the secured randomized caches. In this work, we first categorize different types of cache designs into four broad classes based on the extent of non-determinism and randomness of allocating an address in those caches. We then develop a mathematical framework to formally analyse the security implications of the randomized and partitioned cache designs in terms of collision probability, self-collision probability and size of the eviction set required to perform a successful eviction-based attack. We further empirically demonstrate set associative eviction on recently proposed randomization schemes called Mirage and Scattercache. Next, we propose two algorithms to generate efficient eviction set on these schemes and analytically evaluate the efficacy of our algorithms against the one proposed in the literature. Finally, we argue that mere randomization using a cryptographic primitive as used in popular schemes like Scattercache, CEASER-S, Mirage etc. does not provide the required randomness. Although the randomized-partitioned caches provide some resilience against eviction-set generation techniques, they are still vulnerable to eviction-based attacks.","2378-203X","978-1-6654-7652-2","10.1109/HPCA56546.2023.10071041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071041","","Microarchitecture;Cache memory;Side-channel attacks;Computer architecture;Signal generators;Partitioning algorithms;Reliability","cache storage;cryptography;probability","cache based side-channel attacks;cache lines;cache location mappings;CEASER-S;conflicting sets;cryptographic primitive;eviction-based attacks;eviction-set generation techniques;mathematical framework;mere randomization;microarchitectural state changes;Mirage;mitigation techniques;partitioned cache designs;randomized cache designs;randomized-partitioned caches;Scattercache;self-collision probability;shared cache memory","","","","34","IEEE","24 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It characterizes whether a “secret” of a system can be inferred by an outside observer called an “intruder.” We consider the problem of enforcing opacity in partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as automata. We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting additional observable events. The insertion function must respond to the full system's output behavior. Also, the insertion function should not create new observed behavior but only replicate existing observable strings. We define the property of “i-enforceability,” when there exists an insertion function that renders a non-opaque system opaque. To synthesize insertion functions that ensure opacity, we define and construct a new structure called the “All Insertion Structure” (AIS). The AIS can be used to verify if a given opacity property is i-enforceable. The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity property has been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function.","0743-1546","978-1-4673-2066-5","10.1109/CDC.2012.6426760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6426760","","Automata;Observers;Security;Monitoring;Synchronization;Solids;ISO standards","automata theory;discrete event systems;security of data","opacity properties;insertion functions;confidentiality property;security properties;networked systems;partially-observed discrete event systems;automata;enforcement mechanism based;i-enforceability;all insertion structure","","13","","15","IEEE","4 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All these attacks are centered around a common set of behaviors: During speculative execution, the architectural state of the system is kept unmodified, until the speculation can be verified. In the event that a misspeculation occurs, then anything that can affect the architectural state is reverted (squashed) and re-executed correctly. However, the same is not true for the microarchitectural state. Normally invisible to the user, changes to the microarchitectural state can be observed through various side-channels, with timing differences caused by the memory hierarchy being one of the most common and easy to exploit. The speculative side-channels can then be exploited to perform attacks that can bypass software and hardware checks in order to leak information. These attacks, out of which the most infamous are perhaps Spectre and Meltdown, have led to a frantic search for solutions. In this work, we present our own solution for reducing the microarchitectural state-changes caused by speculative execution in the memory hierarchy. It is based on the observation that if we only allow accesses that hit in the L1 data cache to proceed, then we can easily hide any microarchitectural changes until after the speculation has been verified. At the same time, we propose to prevent stalls by value predicting the loads that miss in the L1. Value prediction, though speculative, constitutes an invisible form of speculation, not seen outside the core. We evaluate our solution and show that we can prevent observable microarchitectural changes in the memory hierarchy while keeping the performance and energy costs at 11% and 7%, respectively. In comparison, the current state of the art solution, InvisiSpec, incurs a 46% performance loss and a 51% energy increase.","2575-713X","978-1-4503-6669-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8980347","speculative execution;side-channel attacks;caches","","cache storage;computer architecture;cryptography;microprocessor chips","invisible speculative execution;high-performance general-purpose CPUs;microarchitectural state-changes;speculative side-channels;architectural state;security attacks;memory hierarchy;value prediction","","","","62","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With their inherent nature, active (Event- Condition-Action or ECA) rules are prospective candidates to carry out change detection and to provide access control. Current systems or models do not provide a flexible mechanism for enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) standard and its extensions in a seamless way, and do not adapt to policy or role structure changes in enterprises, which are indispensable to make RBAC usable in diverse domains. In this paper we will show how On-When-Then-Else authorization rules (or enhanced ECA rules) are used for enforcing RBAC standard and its extensions such as generalized temporal RBAC, control flow dependency constraints, privacy-aware RBAC, and so forth in a seamless way. Furthermore, these rules also provide active security. Large enterprises have hundreds of roles, which requires thousands of rules for providing access control, and generating these rules manually is error-prone and a cognitive-burden for non-computer specialists. Thus, in this paper, we will discuss briefly how these authorization rules can be automatically (or semi-automatically) generated from high level specifications of enterprise access control policies. We will also discuss the implementation using Sentinel+, an active object oriented system.","","0-7695-2657-8","10.1109/ICDE.2005.179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1647810","","Authorization;Access control;Security;Object oriented modeling;Information technology;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Delay;Error correction;Privacy","","","","6","","32","IEEE","5 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model captures emergent behavior resulting from interactions of multiple network agents including the number of workstations, regular, administrator and third-party users, external and internal attacks, defense mechanisms for the network setting, and many other parameters. A risk-based approach to modelling cybersecurity of a business entity is utilized to derive the rate of attacks. A neural network model will generalize the type of attack based on network traffic features allowing dynamic state changes. Rules of engagement to generate self-organizing behavior will be leveraged to appoint a defense mechanism suitable for the attack-state of the model. The effectiveness of the model will be depicted by time-state chart that shows the number of affected assets for the different types of attacks triggered by the entity risk and the time it takes to revert into normal state.

But operating conditions within this domain strongly favour malicious actors over legitimate operators seeking to provide security and protect systems and information. Technical capabilities to establish dominance and cause damage in this domain are widely distributed, but legal and ethical constraints prevent legitimate actors from using them to their full potential. Within this context, net neutrality presents a limiting factor on the capability of legitimate actors to respond to harmful activity in cyberspace whose common aim is to install and uphold a technical imbalance. Under the principle of net neutrality, each data packet must be transmitted with equal priority, irrespective of its source, destination, content or purpose. This is disadvantageous to cyber defence. Comparisons to jungle or arctic warfare, where operating conditions are neutral and degrade the performance of each combatant side equally, are invalid, as malicious operators are capable of technically manipulating data traffic to their favour. While both malicious and legitimate actors may have comparable capabilities, legitimate actors are bound to legal and political restrictions, making them immobile in several cyber warfare scenarios. Transferring the principles of net neutrality to real life scenarios corresponds to depriving military, police and emergency operators from any privilege that allows them to respond to an incident - in effect, depriving them of their blue lights and emergency powers even in severe incidents targeting critical infrastructure that may threaten civilian lives. This paper investigates the potential opportunities and challenges of an adjustment to the principle of net neutrality to facilitate defensive action by legitimate actors; how this adjustment could contribute to regaining control in congested cyber domains in the case of national or international cyber incidents; and the risks associated. The different ways of dealing with net neutrality in cyber defence situations in the EU, UK and Russia are compared. Particular focus is put on the organisations and capabilities needed to establish technical sovereignty in multi-domain networks, including consideration of the acceptability of outsourcing the task of upholding cyber sovereignty to external institutions.","2325-5374","978-9-9499-9043-6","10.23919/CYCON.2018.8405015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8405015","net neutrality;cyber defence;cyber security;net regulation","Network neutrality;Critical infrastructure;Cyberspace;Cyber warfare;Internet","computer crime;Internet","congested domain;operating conditions;legitimate operators;technical capabilities;legitimate actors;net neutrality;malicious operators;technically manipulating data traffic;cyber warfare scenarios;police;emergency operators;national incidents;international cyber incidents;critical national infrastructure;highly contested domain;malicious actors;unprotected individual users;cyber defence;EU;UK;Russia;multidomain networks","","2","","","","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A large number of applications relate to cellular and mobile telephony, pagers, local area networks, cordless phones, global positioning systems (GPS), and security systems. Pseudo-SAW (PSAW) and high velocity PSAW (HVPSAW) have received great attention because of their high phase velocities and, therefore, the high frequencies of operation that these modes provide. In addition to high phase velocities, the pseudomodes must also present low propagation losses and considerably high electromechanical coupling coefficients to be considered for surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. This paper verifies that the metallic layer thickness is a relevant SAW device parameter, which must be considered to achieve lower losses for high frequency, low loss SAW devices. Popular PSAW and HVPSAW material orientations, such as 64/spl deg/ YX LiNbO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/-26/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), 36/spl deg/ YX LiTaO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/ -54/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), LiNbO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 36/spl deg/), LiTaO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 31/spl deg/), and Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/ (0/spl deg/ 47.3/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/), are considered as examples. In addition to the reduced loss analysis and the dispersion analysis for the pseudo modes, the present work discusses the transitions with respect to the layer thickness from the PSAWs and HVPSAWs to the generalized SAWs (GSAWs) and Rayleigh (sagittal particle motion) modes. In addition to contributing to the knowledge of the pseudomodes behavior with layer thickness, this mode transition analysis enlightens the situation in which the losses in the pseudo modes go to zero because of the merging of the pseudo modes into the SAWs (GSAWs and Rayleigh). The fact that the SAWs are a continuation as a function of thickness for the pseudo modes may be conveniently used in the fabrication of low loss devices. In addition, the effects of heavy layer metals, such as gold, in reducing the layer thickness at which the pseudo modes merge to the SAWs are discussed.

This paper describes MemTracker, a new hardware support mechanism that can be configured to perform different kinds of memory access monitoring tasks. MemTracker associates each word of data in memory with a few bits of state, and uses a programmable state transition table to react to different events that can affect this state. The number of state bits per word, the events to which MemTracker reacts, and the transition table are all fully programmable. MemTracker's rich set of states, events, and transitions can be used to implement different monitoring and debugging checkers with minimal performance overheads, even when frequent state updates are needed. To evaluate MemTracker, we map three different checkers onto it, as well as a checker that combines all three. For the most demanding (combined) checker, we observe performance overheads of only 2.7% on average and 4.8% worst-case on SPEC 2000 applications.

Software verification is a powerful solution to ensure the correctness and security of IoT firmware programs. Unfortunately, due to the complex semantics and syntax of program languages (typically C), applying software verification in IoT firmware faces the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. One of the fundamental reasons is that verification methods cannot support verifying state transitions on the memory space caused by pointer operations well. To this end, by combining sparse value flow (SVF) analysis into model checking and optimizing computational redundancy among them, we design a novel points-to-sensitive model checker, called PCHECKER, which can provide a highly precise and efficient verification for IoT firmware programs. We first design a spatial flow model to effectively describe state behaviors of a C program both on the symbolic and memory space. We then propose a counterexample-guided model checking algorithm that can dynamically refine abstract precisions and update nondeterministic points-to relations. With a set of C benchmarks containing a variety of pointer operations and other complex C features, our experiments have shown that compared with state of the art (SOTA), PCHECKER can achieve outstanding results in the verification tasks of C programs that its verification accuracy is 95.9%, and its average verification time of each line of code is 1.27 ms, which are both better than existing model checkers.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3163383","Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2022JQ-611); Basic Research Programs of Taicang(grant numbers:TC2020JC03); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515110279); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:D5000210588); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745051","Model checking;pointer analysis;spare value flow analysis;software verification","Model checking;Computational modeling;Software;Internet of Things;Analytical models;Semantics;Security","C language;firmware;Internet of Things;program verification;storage management","C program;firmware vulnerabilities;software verification;IoT firmware programs;complex semantics;program languages;pointer operations;sparse value flow analysis;spatial flow model;nondeterministic points-to relations;state transition verification;points-to-sensitive model checker;counterexample-guided model checking;Internet of Things;memory space;SVF;computational redundancy;PCHECKER","","","","45","IEEE","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Coordinated evolution of the various elements of a decentralized system may be difficult, if not impossible, as individual organizations evolve their service offerings in response to organization- and service-specific pressures, including market demand, technology, competitive and cooperative interests, and funding. Consequently, decentralized services offer unique challenges for evolution and adaptation that reach well beyond any one single organizational boundary. However, client-driven service customization and tailoring is a powerful tool for meeting conflicting, independent client demands in an environment where disorderly and uneven service evolution predominates. To this end, we contribute an architectural style, COmputAtional State Transfer (COAST), designed to provide extensive, safe, and secure client-directed customization of decentralized services.

Different from previous approaches, the proposed method accurately evaluates the annual cost and benefits obtainable by FACTS devices installation by formulating a large-scale optimization problem that contains power flow analyses for a large number of system states representing annual power system operations. In addition, dynamic state transitions caused by specified contingencies are also simulated in the optimization problem to evaluate the effect of FACTS control actions as well as the other coordinated controls. The expected cost consists of operating cost under normal and contingency states along with their related probabilities to occur. Maximizing social welfare is the objective for normal state while minimizing compensations for generations re-scheduling and load shedding as well as maximizing social welfare are the objectives in case of contingency.

A dedicated algorithm is developed to simulate the dynamic profile of the cascading failures, with consideration of the effect of power overloading, malware contagion and interdependency between the power grid and cyber network. Stimulation results on two test cases show that the dynamic profile of the cascading failures in the coupled system displays a “staircase-like” pattern, which can be interpreted as a combined feature of the typical step propagation profile triggered repeatedly by cyber attacks due to network coupling. Furthermore, compared with the isolated power system without coupling cyber network, both the extent and rapidity of power blackouts were intensified by the cyber coupling especially under the cyber attack.","","978-1-5090-5157-1","10.1109/IFEEC.2017.7992139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7992139","","Power system faults;Power system protection;Malware;Smart grids;Computers;Stochastic processes","invasive software;power system reliability;power system security;smart power grids","cyber-coupled smart grid;cyber attack;stochastic model;cascading failures;power system coupling;cyber networks;power system safety;power system robustness;state transition description;power overloading;malware contagion;power grid;staircase-like pattern;step propagation profile;network coupling;isolated power system;power blackouts","","","","14","IEEE","27 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We leverage the packet transmission policies in Wi-Fi to actively elicit packets for the channel state check without modifying the Wi-Fi protocol, such as sending a dummy data packet which will automatically elicit an acknowledgement packet. Comparing to the existing methods that wait passively for the packets from the packet sender for the channel state information, TBAS has the full control of time to collect the channel state, such that it can use stricter rules to classify the packets and achieve higher security. We solve key problems in TBAS, including a Channel State Check (CSC) procedure which determines if two packets are from the same sender, as well as a simple protocol wrapped around CSC to reduce the overhead. We implement TBAS on the Sora software defined ratio and our trace-driven emulations show that TBAS can achieve desirable False Positive and False Negative ratios with very low overhead.","","978-1-5090-1732-4","10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7733021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7733021","","Probes;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Physical layer;Authentication;Protocols;OFDM;History","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","time bounded anti-spoofing;TBAS;spoof detection method;Wi-Fi networks;channel states;channel state change;packet transmission policies;dummy data packet;acknowledgement packet;channel state information;channel state check procedure;CSC procedure;Sora software defined ratio;trace-driven emulations;false positive ratios;false negative ratios","","6","","20","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach generates local interference and, since the same local environment is used, could lead to security problems. We are investigating the exploitation of idle times in network resources based on a complete mode change in a candidate node. After the detection that some node is idle, a mode-switcher boots a new operating system that will work over a separate disk partition. After the boot phase the node is linked to a logical network topology and is available to receive jobs. Users can allocate nodes from this virtual cluster through a standard frontend as they would do in a ""conventional"" cluster. Because nodes may leave and join this virtual machine we use a distributed processor management to allow user applications to cope with this dynamic resource behavior.

The Delay-on-Miss technique is one such approach, which simply delays loads that miss in the L1 cache until they become non-speculative, resulting in no transient changes in the memory hierarchy. However, this costs performance, prompting the use of value prediction (VP) to regain some of the delay.However, the problem cannot be solved by simply introducing a new kind of speculation (value prediction). Value-predicted loads have to be validated, which cannot be commenced until the load becomes non-speculative. Thus, value-predicted loads occupy the same amount of precious core resources (e.g., reorder buffer entries) as Delay-on-Miss. The end result is that VP only yields marginal benefits over Delay-on-Miss.In this paper, our insight is that we can achieve the same goal as VP (increasing performance by providing the value of loads that miss) without incurring its negative side-effect (delaying the release of precious resources), if we can safely, non-speculatively, recompute a value in isolation (without being seen from the outside), so that we do not expose any information by transferring such a value via the memory hierarchy. Value Recomputation, which trades computation for data transfer was previously proposed in an entirely different context: to reduce energy-expensive data transfers in the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of value recomputation in relation to the Delay-on-Miss approach of hiding speculation, discuss the trade-offs, and show that we can achieve the same level of security, reaching 93% of the unsecured baseline performance (5% higher than Delay-on-miss), and exceeding (by 3%) what even an oracular (100% accuracy and coverage) value predictor could do.","","978-1-6654-2025-9","10.1109/SEED51797.2021.00021","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604354","security;microarchitecture;recomputation;speculation","Microarchitecture;Costs;Side-channel attacks;Data transfer;Software;Delays;Security","cache storage;computer architecture;cryptography","value recomputation;speculative side-channel attacks;microarchitectural state changes;Delay-on-Miss technique;memory hierarchy;value prediction;VP;value-predicted loads;invisible speculation performance;L1 cache","","","","51","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Asymmetric information games are particularly relevant for security problems, e.g., where an attacker knows its own skill set or alternatively a system administrator knows the state of its resources. In such settings, the informed player is faced with the tradeoff of exploiting its superior information at the cost of revealing its superior information. This tradeoff is typically addressed through randomization, in an effort to keep the uninformed player informationally off balance. A lingering issue is the explicit computation of such strategies. This paper, building on prior work for repeated games, presents an LP formulation to compute suboptimal strategies for the informed player in discounted asymmetric information stochastic games in which state transitions are not affected by the uninformed player. Furthermore, the paper presents bounds between the security level guaranteed by the sub-optimal strategy and the optimal value.

Recently, radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based identification schemes have attracted wide attention as they extract the inherent characteristics of hardware circuits which is very hard to forge. However, existing RF fingerprint-based approaches face the problems of unstable region of interest (ROI), high-cost feature design, and incomplete automation. To address these problems, this paper proposes a multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract RF fingerprint from the selected ROI for classifying ZigBee devices. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive ROI selection algorithm is also developed to alleviate the effect of semi-steady behavior of ZigBee devices owing to sleep mode switching. The proposed MSCNN uses multiple downsampling transformations for multiscale feature extraction and classification automatically. To validate and evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we design a testbed consisting of one low-cost universal software radio peripheral (USRP) as the receiver and 54 CC2530 devices as targets for identification. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MSCNN both in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. The classification accuracy is as high as 97% under the LOS scenarios around SNR = 30 dB.

Additionally, the clever attackers have the ability to not only access and monitor the smart grid, but also hack it by launching well-established cyber-attacks. Thus, this article is devoted to understanding the potential stealthy cyber-attack and its countermeasure. First, this article proposes a stealthy sparse cyber-attack model in an ac smart grid by considering both the residual test-based detector and the interval-state-estimation-based detector, which is not considered in previous studies. The design model is formulated as a constrained optimization problem by minimizing the number of contaminated meters, where the characteristics of two types of detector are considered simultaneously as the constraints for the first time. A constrained differential evolution (CDE) is proposed as the solver because the optimization problem is NP-hard. Then, a generalized-cumulative-sum-based detector is developed to detect the proposed cyber-attacks, where a fractional-order state transition matrix is originally introduced into the estimator to describe the dynamics of the power system. Numerical studies illustrate the feasibility of CDE-based stealthy sparse cyber-attacks and the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2021.3129487","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1966202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623481","Constrained differential evolution (CDE);false data injection attack (FDIA);generalized cumulative sum;smart grid security;stealthy sparse cyber-attack","Detectors;Smart grids;Optimization;State estimation;Phasor measurement units;Power system dynamics;Pollution measurement","computer crime;distributed power generation;evolutionary computation;optimisation;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","ac smart grid;next-generation power grids;advanced information;communication technology;cyber-attack threats;critical ICT systems;clever attackers;countermeasure;stealthy sparse cyber-attack model;residual test-based detector;interval-state-estimation-based detector;constrained optimization problem;constrained differential evolution;generalized-cumulative-sum-based detector;power system;CDE-based stealthy sparse cyber-attacks","","17","","35","IEEE","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A normally operating high-voltage transmission network could approximately satisfy the linearization conditions so the ISFs remain constant. The existing ISFs calculation method is the DC approximations based on the branch reactance matrix. But this method has inherent drawbacks resulting in its inaccuracy in two aspects: (1) the parameters of power system elements are hard to acquire accurately because of parameter offset as operation states change; (2) we need to set a reference node to balance the power flow, but the setting is often inconsistent with the real balance strategy. In the above context, we propose a measurement-based estimation method which uses robust least-squares estimation and SCADA measurement data to calculate the ISFs. The effectiveness of the method is verified by comparing the ISFs got from the measurement-based robust estimation with the ones got from DC approximations and the ordinary least-squares estimation (LSE).","","978-1-4799-5032-4","10.1109/POWERCON.2014.6993679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993679","Injection shift factors;Least-squares estimation;Robust least-squares estimation;SCADA measurement data","Estimation;Transmission line measurements;Transmission line matrix methods;Load flow;Approximation methods;Robustness","estimation theory;least squares approximations;load flow;power generation scheduling;power system management;power system measurement;power system security;transmission networks","measurement-based estimation method;injection shift factors;ISF calculation method;real-time scheduling;security check;congestion management;high-voltage transmission network;linearization conditions;branch reactance matrix;power system elements;power flow;least-squares estimation;SCADA measurement data","","","","16","IEEE","22 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These vulnerabilities can be created by improper designs or by the synthesis tool which introduces additional don't-care states and transitions during the optimization and synthesis process. An attacker can utilize these vulnerabilities to perform fault injection attacks or insert malicious hardware modifications (Trojan) to gain unauthorized access to some specific states. To our knowledge, no systematic approaches have been proposed to analyze these vulnerabilities in FSM. In this paper, we develop a framework named Analyzing Vulnerabilities in FSM (AVFSM) which extracts the state transition graph (including the don't-care states and transitions) from a gate-level netlist using a novel Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) based approach and quantifies the vulnerabilities of the design to fault injection and hardware Trojan insertion. We demonstrate the applicability of the AVFSM framework by analyzing the vulnerabilities in the FSM of AES and RSA encryption module. We also propose a low-cost mitigation technique to make FSM more secure against these attacks.","","978-1-4673-8729-3","10.1145/2897937.2897992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7544332","","Circuit faults;Trojan horses;Hardware;Encryption;Integrated circuits;Logic gates","automatic test pattern generation;fault tolerant computing;finite state machines;graph theory;integrated circuit reliability;public key cryptography","vulnerability identification;vulnerability mitigation;finite state machine;digital systems;system security;don't-care states;optimization process;synthesis process;improper designs;synthesis tool;fault injection attacks;malicious hardware modifications;unauthorized access;analyzing vulnerabilities in FSM;state transition graph;gate-level netlist;automatic test pattern generation;ATPG-based approach;design vulnerabilities;fault injection;hardware Trojan insertion;AVFSM framework;AES encryption module;RSA encryption module;low-cost mitigation technique","","47","","15","","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a certification technique for confidentiality of complete Java classes that includes non-interference and erasure policies. This technique is based on rewriting logic, which is a very general logical and semantic framework that is efficiently implemented in the high-level programming language Maude. In order to achieve a finite state transition system, we develop an abstract Java semantics which correctly approximates non-interference and erasure.

However, due to the inherent mechanical energy consumption and the long-range signal propagation pathloss, the traditional cruising and hovering UAV relay modes are deficient in energy utilization and secrecy rate, respectively. Modeling of the secrecy energy efficiency with respect to UAV mode adaptation is limited in the literature and deserves further investigation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secrecy rate-energy efficient UAV relay mode adaptation scheme for secure wireless communications scenarios where the eavesdropping locations are known, i.e., the eavesdropper is a hijacked internal legitimate node. In this secure system, the UAV cooperatively assists the legitimate transmissions and injects artificial interference to the eavesdropper. We investigate optimum UAV placement and relay period planning for the hovering and the cruising relay modes, respectively. By modeling the UAV modes transfer and maximizing the secrecy energy efficiency, the optimum mode adaptation ratios are obtained under both the secrecy rate-prioritized and the energy-saving criteria. In addition, the proposed UAV relay mode adaptation mechanism is further studied for each UAV task division, to adapt to the dynamic channel variations and enhance the security. Our theoretical analysis shows that the mode adaptation ratio is determined by the secrecy rate-energy gain between the cruising and the hovering modes, and by the energy consumption threshold of the UAV relays. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves higher secrecy energy efficiency than the traditional schemes.","2473-2400","","10.1109/TGCN.2023.3243394","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3904404,2020YFB1807003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071250,62222107,62071223,62031012,62271399); Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by China Association for Science and Technology; Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:20KJB510033); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2242022R40030); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2022KW-07); Erik Jonsson Distinguished Professorship at UT-Dalla; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040747","UAV;secrecy rate;energy efficiency;mode adaptation;relay","Autonomous aerial vehicles;Relays;Three-dimensional displays;Monitoring;Eavesdropping;Security;Wireless communication","artificial intelligence;autonomous aerial vehicles;energy conservation;energy consumption;mobile radio;optimisation;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless channels","artificial interference;artificial noise;cruising UAV relay modes;dynamic channel variations;eavesdroppers;eavesdropping locations;energy consumption threshold;energy utilization;energy-saving criteria;hijacked internal legitimate node;hovering UAV relay modes;inherent mechanical energy consumption;legitimate transmission;legitimate transmissions;long-range signal propagation pathloss;mode adaptation ratio;mode adaptive secure UAV relay transmissions;optimum mode adaptation ratios;optimum UAV placement;relay period;secrecy energy efficiency;secrecy rate improvement;secrecy rate-energy efficient UAV relay mode adaptation scheme;secrecy rate-energy gain;secrecy rate-prioritized criteria;secure system;secure wireless communications scenarios;security enhancement;UAV modes transfer;UAV relay mode adaptation mechanism;UAV task division;unmanned aerial vehicles;wireless transmission security enhancement","","","","27","IEEE","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system voltage and frequency will be stable as long as the output frequency and voltage of the master resource are stable. Furthermore, it can fully utilize the power supply capacity of resources to support the supply–demand balance. The following tasks are included in the proposed strategy: 1) to improve the operational security in the face of load disruption, a source–storage–load coordinated control method based on the “ramping speed” ratio is proposed, which can quickly restore the balance of supply and demand; 2) to improve the communication reliability in the face of interruption, a channel planning method is proposed, which can address the communication interruption problem by constructing an internal network among source–storage–load; and 3) to improve the mode switching stability of resources subjected to external disturbance, the external disturbance suppression and stability analysis involved in the regulation process are completed using sliding-mode control and small signal model methods.

IRI 2004.","23 May 2005","2004","","","467","474","Due to increasing incidents of security breaches in the cyber space, a rigorous user authentication process has become crucial. A very feasible biometric approach to verify the authenticity of a user is to examine his/her typing patterns. There is a significant difference in the keystroke patterns exhibited from person to person, even when asked to type the same words. Typing patterns can be shown in the intervals between keys, holding time, overlap keys, etc. Individuals typing pattern develops naturally and uniquely just as each person write differently. We propose an analytical process based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) to learn the special patterns from individuals, and then to identify them. During training, the timing information of each keystroke is recorded at its holding and releasing events, and the pattern is then extracted from the relationship of the events within a word. The experiment to be conducted is to authenticate users when entering words. The idea is to implement a process to examine the typing pattern as a user enters his/her password, in order to augment the conventional password system. We find the discrete first-order HMM to be very suitable for our purpose. Due to the nondeterministic nature of the keystroke events, modeling with a stochastic process such as the HMM which has probabilistic state transitions can not only recognize the patterns in the keys already typed, but also predict the following sequence. The issue is similar to the recognition of hand-written characters or spoken words. The experimental results are nearly perfect among twenty test subjects all randomly chosen in a controlled environment of a standard computer laboratory.","","0-7803-8819-4","10.1109/IRI.2004.1431505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431505","","Hidden Markov models;Pattern analysis;Computer security;Authentication;Biometrics;Timing;Data mining;Predictive models;Stochastic processes;Pattern recognition","hidden Markov models;message authentication;biometrics (access control);pattern recognition","hidden Markov model;keystroke pattern analysis;password verification;user authentication process;biometric approach;stochastic process;probabilistic state transition;pattern recognition","","19","","18","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detection of such deceptive information obtained during online interactions (emails, chat room conversations) is the first step before counter strategies can be developed. With the large-scale use of information technologies as a general communication medium, facilitating deception detection is a key enabler to utilizing information systems to their fullest potential. This article presents a framework for computer-aided deception detection building on the interpersonal deception theory (IDT) of human interpersonal communication research and text-processing techniques for facilitating deception analysis of text-oriented communication. A state-transition diagram based framework is proposed to model the dynamic evolution of an interpersonal conversation between a sender and receiver based on the IDT-based process schemata. The framework is then utilized to develop a deception detection agent to process textual information. Deception detection is defined as a process of model verification.

The key advantage to integrating the heterogeneity in the functional specification of the design is that we can configure the variants during or post-manufacturing, but removal, extraction or deletion of the variants is not viable. Experimental results on benchmark circuits demonstrate that the method can be automatically and efficiently implemented. Because of its lightweight, N-variant design is particularly well-suited for securing embedded systems. As a proof-of-concept, we implement the N-variant method for content protection in portable media players, e.g., iPod. We discuss how the N-variant design methodology readily enables new digital rights management methods.","0738-100X","978-1-60558-115-6","10.1145/1391469.1391606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4555876","N-variant Design;Digital Rights Management;Physical Security","Application specific integrated circuits;Design methodology;Protection;Portable media players;Sequential circuits;Security;Design optimization;Fault tolerance;Automata;Algorithm design and analysis","digital integrated circuits;embedded systems;fault tolerance;finite state machines;integrated circuit design;sequential circuits","N-variant IC design;sequential circuits;fault-tolerance;finite state machine;benchmark circuits;securing embedded systems;digital rights management methods","","7","4","20","","2 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The technique is based on rewriting logic, which is efficiently implemented in the high-level programming language Maude. Starting from a previous Java abstract semantics specification written in Maude, we develop an information flow sensitive Java semantics that allows us to observe global non-interference properties, with object aliasing. In order to achieve a finite state transition system, we develop an abstract Java semantics that we use for secure and effective confidentiality analysis.

Users can employ the same interface to invoke various applications from the Internet. For security purposes, service providers would control the access to the provided interface through policy enforcement. Yet the access control of REST interfaces lacks a uniform standard regarding the policy language and corresponding enforcement implementation, which brings two limitations: i) Users have to deal with totally different types of policies to accommodate certain systems. ii) Service providers have to design their own platform-specific authorization policy language and the related enforcement mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a REST Policy Language (RestPL) to express the authorization policies especially for REST APIs. RestPL is ensured to be request-oriented, based on our definition of the standard request form. This indicates that a RestPL policy can be automatically generated from an actual request, which helps mitigate a user's pressure during policy designing. Furthermore, we also provide a reference implementation for the enforcement code of RestPL based on regular expressions and deploy it on OpenStack Liberty to demonstrate its feasibility. The experimental results indicate the enforcement overhead of RestPL can be reduced to 80.6% compared with the original policy. In addition, we show that an end-user can also benefit from RestPL for reducing the learning effort by at least 41.6%.","","978-1-5090-2675-3","10.1109/ICWS.2016.92","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7558065","representational state transfer;access control;security policy;request-oriented","Cloud computing;Standards;Authorization;Grammar","application program interfaces;authorisation;formal languages;Web services","RestPL;request-oriented policy language;RESTful API;Web applications;cloud computing systems;representational state transfer;Internet;security purposes;service providers;access control;policy enforcement;REST interfaces;authorization policy language;REST policy language;regular expressions;OpenStack Liberty","","5","","18","IEEE","1 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These protocols are expected to guarantee security, speed, low latency, less power consumption, reliability and efficient transfer of information between the devices. There are several application layer protocols available like Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Representational State Transfer (RESTFUL Services) and Data Distribution Services (DDS) that are employed in practice. The suitable protocol is selected based on the nature and requirements of the IoT system. However there are no standard guidelines in deciding a particular protocol for the IoT application. There is always uncertainty in deciding the application protocol suitable for the IoT requirements. Thereby, it is inevitable to know the strengths and weakness of the widely accepted protocols to determine the best-fit scenarios. Amongst these CoAP and MQTT are the most diffused protocols in the IoT landscape. This paper surveys five established protocols – CoAP, MQTT, Websocket, XMPP and AMQP. It discusses the origin of these protocols, the general characteristics, advantages and limitations. Furthermore, the paper does an in-depth comparative analysis of the protocols against the suitability of application areas. Additionally, the paper also explains the standard implementation architecture of the protocols. Thus the detailed evaluation will result in helping to choose the best suited protocol for any given IoT system.","","978-1-6654-0430-3","10.1109/ICCICT50803.2021.9510140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9510140","CoAP;MQTT;XMPP;AMQP;Websocket;RESTFUL","Protocols;Uncertainty;Computer architecture;Quality of service;Representational state transfer;Internet of Things;Security","Internet of Things;power aware computing;power consumption;protocols;queueing theory;telemetry","Advanced Message Queuing Protocol;IoT application;diffused protocols;application layer protocol;application interfaces;Constrained Application Protocol;Internet of Things;power consumption;CoAP;message queue telemetry transport;MQTT;Websocket;extensible messaging and presence protocol;XMPP;AMQP;representational state transfer services;RESTFUL services;data distribution services;DDS","","4","","23","IEEE","12 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper presents an approach to design a service for policy management which enables railway operator to create, update and delete policy rules and to control the access to them. Using the Policy service, FRMCS applications can request policy evaluation in order to perform functions such as application authorization, communication authorization, arbitration between competing communications, and multiuser talker control. The Policy service design follows the principles of REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. Policy service resources, methods and data types are defined. The usage of the Policy service interfaces is illustrated by the FRMCS Arbitration application which makes rule based prioritization of communications competing for the attention of a FRMCS user.

However, how to divide the administrative privileges remains a difficulty in practice. In this work, we simplify the privilege partitioning problem into a classification problem of RESTful functions, so the permission to call a category of functions can be granted to a specific administrator. We propose a RESTful API classification approach called RestSep based on genetic algorithm. A classification is represented as a 2-dimensional matrix, which is used as the chromosome. Customized operators of selection, mutation and crossover are designed. The fitness function is designed to balance parameters such as number of categories, test case coverage, function overlapping, etc. Experiments on popular clouds like OpenStack and Kubernetes indicate RestSep can generate a self-explanatory classification result, which can serve as a guideline for privilege partitioning. The overhead of test generation is at most 13.1% and the overhead of genetic algorithm is at most 183.29s, which are acceptable for practical use.","","978-1-5386-0752-7","10.1109/ICWS.2017.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029806","representational state transfer;privilege partition;genetic algorithm;integration test","Cloud computing;Genetic algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Access control","application program interfaces;authorisation;cloud computing;genetic algorithms;matrix algebra;pattern classification","RestSep;test-oriented privilege partitioning approach;web applications;representational state transfer API;security purposes;service providers;administrative privileges;classification problem;RESTful functions;RESTful API classification approach;genetic algorithm;2-dimensional matrix;fitness function;test case coverage;function overlapping;self-explanatory classification result;test generation;cloud computing systems;mutation operator;crossover operator;access control;selection operator","","2","","23","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A malicious insider like a compromised cloud administrator can affect security of data and workloads belonging to cloud customers. Enforcing the least privilege principle in cloud administration can fairly restrict the permissions of administrators and reduce the attack surface. However, writing a least privilege policy can be hard and error prone for cloud service providers. In this paper, we propose a framework called Least Privilege for Cloud (LPCloud) to address these concerns. LPCloud automatically produces policies for minimization of administrators' privileges at the granularity of representational state transfer (REST) application program interfaces (API), and enforces the policies without affecting current systems. Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithm to partition privileges based on dependencies between API calls. This paper presents design of LPCloud, including a service called Policy Generator which produces partitioned policies and a component named Policy Enforcer to enforce the policies. We implement a prototype of our framework in OpenStack Mitaka. Experiments indicate that LPCloud can produce proper policies to enforce the least privilege principle. Meantime, the average performance overhead is 10.1% which is in acceptable level.","1938-1883","978-1-4673-8999-0","10.1109/ICC.2017.7997107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997107","","Cloud computing;Security;Generators;Testing;Partitioning algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Information systems","application program interfaces;cloud computing;security of data","low-hanging fruit;cloud computing;least privilege policy;cloud administrator;data security;cloud service providers;Least Privilege for Cloud;LPCloud;representational state transfer granularity;REST granularity;application program interfaces;API;OpenStack Mitaka","","","","24","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
