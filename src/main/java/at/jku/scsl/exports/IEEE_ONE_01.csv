Ormon PLCs are widely used in critical manufactures and have adopted factory interface network service (Fins) protocol to exchange message. The recent articles indicate that Ormon PLCs used Fins Ethernet protocol were exposed to mode-switching malicious network attack. However, the traditional detection methods based on function codes and Snort detection rules could not get an ideal result. In this paper, we propose a method that can overcome these problems in dealing with mode-switching attack by an external hash authentication device embedding asymmetric encryption. This security device built into a hash authentication mechanism, which is responsible for identifying and distinguishing the interaction information message between the upper computer and PLC interaction information.

Likewise, many security solutions now exist within SDN environments for detecting and blocking clients who violate network policies. However, many of these solutions stop at triggering the security measure and give little thought to amending it. As a consequence, once the violation is addressed, no clear path exists for reinstating the flagged client beyond having the network operator reset the controller or manually implement a state change via an external command. This presents a burden for the network and its clients and administrators. Hence, we present a security policy transition framework for revoking security measures in an SDN environment once said measures are activated.","","978-1-5090-0933-6","10.1109/NFV-SDN.2016.7919476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7919476","Security Policy Transitions;Software Defined Networks;SDN;Network Operating System;NOS;Network Security Policies;Network Access Control;NAC;RYU;Ryuretic","Software;Access control;Ports (Computers);Kinetic theory;Monitoring","computer network security;software defined networking","security policy transition framework;software defined networks;programming frameworks;network application development;SDN environments;external command","","5","","17","IEEE","8 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this paper provides a different approach to network security based on Petri net and Attack tree models. Our objective is to analyze the FCSNS security via the combination of model and state. This method represents the network structure and state transferring by way of Petri net.

We then apply theory of discrete event control to define safety properties of the computer system in terms of the basic concepts of controllability used in discrete event control for two special sublanguages K/sub s/ and K/sub v/. These languages correspond to maximally robust controllable sub-languages. In the third approach, we show that by associating cost with the state transitions, the security quantification problem can be casted as Markov decision problem (MDP).

The authors analyze the TCP code via a ""reverse engineering"" technique called ""program slicing"" to identify several of these vulnerabilities, especially those that are related to the TCP state-transition diagram. They discuss many of the flaws present in the TCP implementation of many widely used operating systems, such as SUNOS 4.1.3, SVR4, and ULTRIX 4.3. The corresponding TCP attack ""signatures"" (including the well-known 1994 Christmas Day Mitnick Attack) are described, and recommendations are provided to improve the security state of a TCP-based system (e.g., incorporation of a ""timer escape route"" from every TCP state).

Existing studies about the security of SDN-enabled smart grid (SDSG) mainly focused on static methods such as access control and identity authentication, which is vulnerable to attackers that carefully probe the system. As the attacks become more variable and complex, there is an urgent need for dynamic defense methods. In this paper, we propose a security function virtualization (SFV) based moving target defense of SDSG which makes the attack surface constantly changing. First, we design a dynamic defense mechanism by migrating virtual security function (VSF) instances as the traffic state changes. The centralized SDN controller is re-designed for global status monitoring and migration management. Moreover, we formalize the VSF instances migration problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem with multiple constraints and design a pre-migration algorithm to prevent VSF instances' resources from being exhausted.

This paper presents an industry best practice of integrated TCP/IP network protocol testing that targets software robustness vulnerabilities. The deployed test system consists of a versatile test engine, a protocol data unit generator and a few auxiliary tools. The specially designed kernel test engine supporting IP/TCP/UDP as carrier protocols drives predefined fault-injected PDU (protocol data unit) to the network unit under test. Its novel callback mechanism and virtual network device connection capability cost-effectively enhance user controlled testing intelligence for verifying protocols with complicated state transitions. The PDU generator aims to provide a systematic solution for rapid test case creation, which is based on new strengthened BNF (Backus-Naur form) language for protocol specification mutation and fault injection. Established on this system, we propose an integrated industry test environment for network protocol code assessment. Initial experiments and case studies with multicast protocols unveiled several robustness violations, which have significant security impacts.","","0-7695-2033-2","10.1109/ICCNMC.2003.1243061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1243061","","TCPIP;Protocols;Software testing;System testing;Robustness;Engines;Data security;Computer industry;Best practices;IP networks","transport protocols;program testing;formal specification;Internet;telecommunication security;multicast protocols","TCP/IP protocol;software testing;vulnerability detection;network security;network protocol;protocol data unit;PDU;kernel test engine;IP/TCP/UDP;callback mechanism;virtual network device connection;BNF language;Backus-Naur form;protocol specification mutation;fault injection;multicast protocols","","8","11","27","IEEE","3 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DPI aims to identify various malware (including spam and viruses) by inspecting both the header and the payload of each packet and comparing it to a known set of patterns. DPI is often performed on the critical path of the packet processing, thus the overall performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of DPI. The seminal algorithm of Aho-Corasick (AC) is the de facto standard for pattern matching in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Basically, the AC algorithm constructs a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) for detecting all occurrences of a given set of patterns by processing the input in a single pass. The input is inspected symbol by symbol (usually each symbol is a byte), such that each symbol results in a state transition. Thus, in principle, the AC algorithm has deterministic performance, which does not depend on specific input and therefore is not vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks, making it very attractive to NIDS systems. In this paper we show that, when implementing the AC algorithm in software, this property does not hold, due to the fact that contemporary pattern sets induce very large DFAs that cannot be stored entirely in cache. We then propose a novel technique to compress the representation of the Aho-Corasick automaton, so it can fit in modern cache. We compare both the performance and the memory footprint of our technique to previously-proposed implementation, under various settings and pattern sets. Our results reveal the space-time tradeoffs of DPI. Specifically, we show that our compression technique reduces the memory footprint of the best prior-art algorithm by approximately 60%, while achieving comparable throughput.","2325-5560","978-1-4244-8456-0","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5985996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5985996","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Software algorithms;Encoding;Pattern matching;Software;Throughput","authorisation;computer networks;Internet","software-based deep;space-time tradeoffs;packet inspection;network intrusion detection;prevention systems;Web application firewalls;DPI;packet processing;deterministic finite automaton;state transition;algorithmic complexity attacks;NIDS systems;AC algorithm;Aho-Corasick automaton;compression technique","","14","2","25","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fins protocol as one of the most popular protocols is built into a larger number of Ormon devices that are used in different kinds of measurement, and control systems and has been targeted as the desirable candidate for cyber-attack. However, the traditional detection method based on traffic analysis and function code compliance detection is unable to detect mode-switching attack that is consistent with the protocol syntax, and it is a very harmful network attack against industrial devices. In this paper, we analyze the defects of measurement and control system using Fins protocol, launch mode-switching attack against Ormon PLC devices and display how to defend against this attack by designing a detection rules insert into Snort. Then, this detection approach is carried out to protect the security of Ormon PLC.

Software that heavily interacts with the underlying OS (e.g., I/O intensive and event-driven applications) suffers from system call overhead. To deteriorate this situation, security vulnerabilities in modern processors have prompted kernel mitigations that further increase the transition overhead. Particularly system-call-heavy applications have been reported to be slowed down by up to 30% with kernel page-table isolation (KPTI), the widely deployed mitigation for the Meltdown vulnerability. To decouple system calls from mode transitions, we revisit an old idea known as system-call batching or multi-calls: the bundling of system calls into a combined call, which only incurs the mode-transition costs of a single one. And then, we have implemented ESCA scheme to adapt system-call batching to Linux-based servers in the light of Meltdown and Spectre, effectively eliminating the slowdown of KPTI-affected applications. Our evaluation shows that the throughputs of real-world applications, benefiting from ESCA, can be improved with only 2 lines of code changed respectively: Nginx by up to 12%, lighttpd by up to 23%, and Redis by 4%. Meanwhile, using aggregated transitions, our approach allows faster system calls interleaved with full compatibility but without requiring Linux kernel patches.","2377-5750","978-1-6654-6958-6","10.1109/PDP55904.2022.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756707","Linux kernel;system call;KPTI","Costs;Program processors;Linux;Semantics;Throughput;Web servers;Software","Linux;operating system kernels","nonprivileged application;OS kernel;CPU's supervisor mode;performance costs;event-driven applications;security vulnerabilities;kernel mitigations;transition overhead;kernel page-table isolation;meltdown vulnerability;mode transitions;system-call batching;multicalls;mode-transition costs;ESCA scheme;Linux-based servers;KPTI-affected applications;real-world applications;aggregated transitions;Linux kernel patches;system call decoupling;system-call-heavy applications;system call aggregation;Nginx;Redis","","","","21","IEEE","18 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Active Appearance Model (AAM) landmarks are considered for each frame of the videos. The AAMs were used to track the face and extract its visual features. There are six different facial expressions considered over here: Happy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Fear and Sad. Different Expression recognition problem is solved through a multistage automatic pattern recognition system where the temporal relationships are modeled through the HMM framework. Dimension levels (i.e., labels) can be defined as the hidden states sequences in the HMM framework. Then the probabilities of these hidden states and their state transitions can be accurately computed from the labels of the training set. Through a three stage classification approach, the output of a first-stage classification is used as observation sequences for a second stage classification, modeled as a HMM-based framework. The k-NN will be used for the first stage classification. A third classification stage, a decision fusion tool, is then used to boost overall performance.","","978-1-4799-2320-5","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892800","Hidden Markov model (HMM);K Nearest Neighbor (k-NN);Active Appearance Model (AAM);Dimension levels","Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Face recognition;Speech recognition;Active appearance model;Support vector machine classification;Speech","biometrics (access control);face recognition;hidden Markov models","hidden states;state transitions;AAM landmarks;active appearance model;HMM framework;ATM;banking;voter verification;residential security;digital image;biometric software application;Hidden Markov Model;automatic human facial expression recognition","","5","","23","IEEE","8 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Noise ""Handshake Patterns"" can support mutual authentication, forward secrecy, zero round-trip encryption, identity hiding and other advanced features. Since the framework's release, Noise-based protocols have been adopted by WhatsApp, WireGuard and other high-profile applications. We present Noise Explorer, an online engine for designing, reasoning about, formally verifying and implementing arbitrary Noise Handshake Patterns. Based on our formal treatment of the Noise Protocol Framework, Noise Explorer can validate any Noise Handshake Pattern and then translate it into a model ready for automated verification and also into a production-ready software implementation written in Go or in Rust. We use Noise Explorer to analyze more than 57 handshake patterns. We confirm the stated security goals for 12 fundamental patterns and provide precise properties for the rest. We also analyze unsafe handshake patterns and document weaknesses that occur when validity rules are not followed. All of this work is consolidated into a usable online tool that presents a compendium of results and can parse formal verification results to generate detailed-but-pedagogical reports regarding the exact security goals of each message of a Noise Handshake Pattern with respect to each party, under an active attacker and including malicious principals. Noise Explorer evolves alongside the standard Noise Protocol Framework, having already contributed new security goal verification results and stronger definitions for pattern validation and security parameters.","","978-1-7281-1148-3","10.1109/EuroSP.2019.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8806757","formal verification;noise protocol framework;cryptographic protocols;secure implementation;secure channel protocols","Protocols;Software;Semantics;Syntactics;Public key","authorisation;cryptographic protocols;formal verification;message authentication","Noise-based protocols;Noise Explorer;arbitrary Noise Handshake Patterns;Noise Handshake Pattern;unsafe handshake patterns;standard Noise Protocol Framework;pattern validation;security parameters;arbitrary noise protocols;secure channel protocols;WireGuard;WhatsApp;local state transitions;complex key derivation","","7","","33","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In spite of the fact that architecture and security communities have explored a vast number of static or dynamic analysis techniques to automatically identify such bugs, the problem remains unsolved and challenging largely due to the complex nature of CPU RTL designs.This paper proposes DIFUZZRTL, an RTL fuzzer to automatically discover unknown bugs in CPU RTLs. DIFUZZRTL develops a register-coverage guided fuzzing technique, which efficiently yet correctly identifies a state transition in the finite state machine of RTL designs. DIFUZZRTL also develops several new techniques in consideration of unique RTL design characteristics, including cycle-sensitive register coverage guiding, asynchronous interrupt events handling, a unified CPU input format with Tilelink protocols, and drop-in-replacement designs to support various CPU RTLs. We implemented DIFUZZRTL, and performed the evaluation with three real-world open source CPU RTLs: OpenRISC Mor1kx Cappuccino, RISC-V Rocket Core, and RISC-V Boom Core. During the evaluation, DIFUZZRTL identified 16 new bugs from these CPU RTLs, all of which were confirmed by the respective development communities and vendors.

Unfortunately, existing software and even hardware approaches for finding and identifying memory bugs have considerable performance overheads, target only a narrow class of bugs, are costly to implement, or use computational resources inefficiently. This paper describes MemTracker, a new hardware support mechanism that can be configured to perform different kinds of memory access monitoring tasks. MemTracker associates each word of data in memory with a few bits of state, and uses a programmable state transition table to react to different events that can affect this state. The number of state bits per word, the events to which MemTracker reacts, and the transition table are all fully programmable. MemTracker's rich set of states, events, and transitions can be used to implement different monitoring and debugging checkers with minimal performance overheads, even when frequent state updates are needed. To evaluate MemTracker, we map three different checkers onto it, as well as a checker that combines all three. For the most demanding (combined) checker, we observe performance overheads of only 2.7% on average and 4.8% worst-case on SPEC 2000 applications. Such low overheads allow continuous (always-on) use of MemTracker-enabled checkers even in production runs","2378-203X","1-4244-0804-0","10.1109/HPCA.2007.346205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147668","","Monitoring;Computer bugs;Hardware;Software debugging;Security;Software tools;Buffer overflow;Memory management;Software performance;Application software","checkpointing;program debugging;software metrics;storage management;system monitoring","MemTracker;memory access monitoring;memory access debugging;software complexity;programmable state transition table;monitoring checker;debugging checker","","81","2","24","IEEE","10 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software verification is a powerful solution to ensure the correctness and security of IoT firmware programs. Unfortunately, due to the complex semantics and syntax of program languages (typically C), applying software verification in IoT firmware faces the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. One of the fundamental reasons is that verification methods cannot support verifying state transitions on the memory space caused by pointer operations well. To this end, by combining sparse value flow (SVF) analysis into model checking and optimizing computational redundancy among them, we design a novel points-to-sensitive model checker, called PCHECKER, which can provide a highly precise and efficient verification for IoT firmware programs. We first design a spatial flow model to effectively describe state behaviors of a C program both on the symbolic and memory space. We then propose a counterexample-guided model checking algorithm that can dynamically refine abstract precisions and update nondeterministic points-to relations. With a set of C benchmarks containing a variety of pointer operations and other complex C features, our experiments have shown that compared with state of the art (SOTA), PCHECKER can achieve outstanding results in the verification tasks of C programs that its verification accuracy is 95.9%, and its average verification time of each line of code is 1.27 ms, which are both better than existing model checkers.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3163383","Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2022JQ-611); Basic Research Programs of Taicang(grant numbers:TC2020JC03); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515110279); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:D5000210588); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745051","Model checking;pointer analysis;spare value flow analysis;software verification","Model checking;Computational modeling;Software;Internet of Things;Analytical models;Semantics;Security","C language;firmware;Internet of Things;program verification;storage management","C program;firmware vulnerabilities;software verification;IoT firmware programs;complex semantics;program languages;pointer operations;sparse value flow analysis;spatial flow model;nondeterministic points-to relations;state transition verification;points-to-sensitive model checker;counterexample-guided model checking;Internet of Things;memory space;SVF;computational redundancy;PCHECKER","","","","45","IEEE","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We leverage the packet transmission policies in Wi-Fi to actively elicit packets for the channel state check without modifying the Wi-Fi protocol, such as sending a dummy data packet which will automatically elicit an acknowledgement packet. Comparing to the existing methods that wait passively for the packets from the packet sender for the channel state information, TBAS has the full control of time to collect the channel state, such that it can use stricter rules to classify the packets and achieve higher security. We solve key problems in TBAS, including a Channel State Check (CSC) procedure which determines if two packets are from the same sender, as well as a simple protocol wrapped around CSC to reduce the overhead.

Main application areas include vehicles or robots that need to collaborate to achieve a common task, e.g., minimize fuel consumption, moving objects at a construction site, or performing a set of operations in a factory. Moreover, these vehicles or robots need to interact and possibly collaborate with humans in a safe way, e.g., avoiding accidents or collisions, and prevent hazardous situations that may harm humans and/or machines. % This paper proposes a framework for developing safe and secure adaptive collaborative systems, with run-time guarantees. To enable this, our focus is on requirement engineering and safety assurance techniques to capture the specific safety and security properties for the collaborative system, and to provide an assurance case guaranteeing that the system is sufficiently safe.

All these attacks are centered around a common set of behaviors: During speculative execution, the architectural state of the system is kept unmodified, until the speculation can be verified. In the event that a misspeculation occurs, then anything that can affect the architectural state is reverted (squashed) and re-executed correctly. However, the same is not true for the microarchitectural state. Normally invisible to the user, changes to the microarchitectural state can be observed through various side-channels, with timing differences caused by the memory hierarchy being one of the most common and easy to exploit. The speculative side-channels can then be exploited to perform attacks that can bypass software and hardware checks in order to leak information. These attacks, out of which the most infamous are perhaps Spectre and Meltdown, have led to a frantic search for solutions. In this work, we present our own solution for reducing the microarchitectural state-changes caused by speculative execution in the memory hierarchy. It is based on the observation that if we only allow accesses that hit in the L1 data cache to proceed, then we can easily hide any microarchitectural changes until after the speculation has been verified. At the same time, we propose to prevent stalls by value predicting the loads that miss in the L1. Value prediction, though speculative, constitutes an invisible form of speculation, not seen outside the core. We evaluate our solution and show that we can prevent observable microarchitectural changes in the memory hierarchy while keeping the performance and energy costs at 11% and 7%, respectively.

The Delay-on-Miss technique is one such approach, which simply delays loads that miss in the L1 cache until they become non-speculative, resulting in no transient changes in the memory hierarchy. However, this costs performance, prompting the use of value prediction (VP) to regain some of the delay.However, the problem cannot be solved by simply introducing a new kind of speculation (value prediction). Value-predicted loads have to be validated, which cannot be commenced until the load becomes non-speculative. Thus, value-predicted loads occupy the same amount of precious core resources (e.g., reorder buffer entries) as Delay-on-Miss. The end result is that VP only yields marginal benefits over Delay-on-Miss.In this paper, our insight is that we can achieve the same goal as VP (increasing performance by providing the value of loads that miss) without incurring its negative side-effect (delaying the release of precious resources), if we can safely, non-speculatively, recompute a value in isolation (without being seen from the outside), so that we do not expose any information by transferring such a value via the memory hierarchy. Value Recomputation, which trades computation for data transfer was previously proposed in an entirely different context: to reduce energy-expensive data transfers in the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of value recomputation in relation to the Delay-on-Miss approach of hiding speculation, discuss the trade-offs, and show that we can achieve the same level of security, reaching 93% of the unsecured baseline performance (5% higher than Delay-on-miss), and exceeding (by 3%) what even an oracular (100% accuracy and coverage) value predictor could do.","","978-1-6654-2025-9","10.1109/SEED51797.2021.00021","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604354","security;microarchitecture;recomputation;speculation","Microarchitecture;Costs;Side-channel attacks;Data transfer;Software;Delays;Security","cache storage;computer architecture;cryptography","value recomputation;speculative side-channel attacks;microarchitectural state changes;Delay-on-Miss technique;memory hierarchy;value prediction;VP;value-predicted loads;invisible speculation performance;L1 cache","","","","51","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based identification schemes have attracted wide attention as they extract the inherent characteristics of hardware circuits which is very hard to forge. However, existing RF fingerprint-based approaches face the problems of unstable region of interest (ROI), high-cost feature design, and incomplete automation. To address these problems, this paper proposes a multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract RF fingerprint from the selected ROI for classifying ZigBee devices. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive ROI selection algorithm is also developed to alleviate the effect of semi-steady behavior of ZigBee devices owing to sleep mode switching. The proposed MSCNN uses multiple downsampling transformations for multiscale feature extraction and classification automatically. To validate and evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we design a testbed consisting of one low-cost universal software radio peripheral (USRP) as the receiver and 54 CC2530 devices as targets for identification. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MSCNN both in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. The classification accuracy is as high as 97% under the LOS scenarios around SNR = 30 dB. Our scheme is robust over a wide range of SNRs under the LOS scenarios as well as under the NLOS scenarios.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2911347","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571110,61602113,61601114); National Natural Science Youth Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801115); Purple Mountain Laboratories (PML); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692418","Multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN);radio frequency (RF) fingerprint;region of interest (ROI) selection;semi-steady portion;ZigBee","Feature extraction;Radio frequency;Zigbee;Internet of Things;Signal to noise ratio;Performance evaluation;Receivers","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;Internet of Things;signal classification;software radio;Zigbee","multiscale feature extraction;low-cost universal software radio peripheral;MSCNN;LOS scenarios;robust RF fingerprinting approach;multisampling convolutional neural network;device identification;radio frequency fingerprint-based identification schemes;hardware circuits;high-cost feature design;ZigBee devices;ROI selection algorithm;semisteady behavior;unstable region of interest;RF fingerprint-based approaches;signal-to-noise ratio adaptive ROI selection algorithm;downsampling transformations","","83","","58","IEEE","16 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior works require multiple access points (AP) deployed in the tracking region or to utilize elaborately selected multipaths in an indoor environment to achieve tracking. However, this prevents their wide adoption because scenarios like homes typically only have a single AP, and using multipaths is vulnerable to unexpected interferences due to the complex indoor environment. This paper proposes a tracking system using only a single AP. The insight behind the proposed system is to mine the multi-dimensional channel parameters from the direct path to realize tracking. Therefore, we develop a model that establishes the correlation between the target motion and channel parameters, including the direct path's angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD). Then, we can formulate the tracking problem as the state transition with the observations. Since the nonlinear observation equation, we use particle filters to solve the problem accurately. Finally, we validate the proposed system via simulation using ray-tracing software. The simulation results show that the median tracking error is 0.21 m based on a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), comparable to previous state-of-the-art systems.","2166-9589","978-1-6654-8053-6","10.1109/PIMRC54779.2022.9977459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9977459","Indoor tracking;single access point;wireless channel model;direct path;particle filter","Wireless communication;Target tracking;Simulation;Ray tracing;Mathematical models;Software;Indoor environment","direction-of-arrival estimation;image motion analysis;indoor radio;Kalman filters;multipath channels;particle filtering (numerical methods);radiowave propagation;ray tracing;target tracking;tracking;wireless LAN","complex indoor environment;decimeter level indoor tracking;direct path;elaborately selected multipaths;elderly care;median tracking error;multidimensional channel parameters;multiple access points;noise figure 20.0 dB;nonlinear observation equation;previous state-of-the-art systems;security monitoring;single access point;single AP;size 0.21 m;target motion;tracking problem;tracking region;tracking system;unexpected interferences","","","","10","IEEE","20 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Coordinated evolution of the various elements of a decentralized system may be difficult, if not impossible, as individual organizations evolve their service offerings in response to organization- and service-specific pressures, including market demand, technology, competitive and cooperative interests, and funding. Consequently, decentralized services offer unique challenges for evolution and adaptation that reach well beyond any one single organizational boundary. However, client-driven service customization and tailoring is a powerful tool for meeting conflicting, independent client demands in an environment where disorderly and uneven service evolution predominates. To this end, we contribute an architectural style, COmputAtional State Transfer (COAST), designed to provide extensive, safe, and secure client-directed customization of decentralized services. COAST combines mechanisms from software architecture, cryptography, security, and programming languages, granting application architects flexible provisioning of their core services and assets while protecting those services and assets from attack and misuse.","","978-1-4673-2809-8","10.1109/WICSA-ECSA.212.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337763","software architecture;decentralized systems;service-oriented architectures;client-driven adaptation","Security;Mobile communication;Engines;Semantics;Organizations;Computer architecture;Context","cloud computing;cryptography;customer services;organisational aspects;programming languages;service-oriented architecture","COAST;decentralized on-demand tailored services;software architectural style;systems-of-systems;organization-specific pressures;service-specific pressures;market demand;funding;organizational boundary;client-driven service customization;client-driven service tailoring;client demands;computational state transfer;cryptography;programming languages;security features;competitive interests;cooperative interests","","4","","52","IEEE","25 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The amount of stored information is so huge that it is highly difficult to manage the content especially in a distributed cloud environment. There are many open source software solutions available in cloud to handle huge amount of digital data. However none of these solutions addresses all the requirements needed to manage the content spread out in multiple systems effectively. The user has to relay on multiple content management systems to do the work. This turns into ever more unwieldy, time consuming and leads to loss of data. Using robust and integrated content management systems, these issues could be solved effectively. In this paper we have identified various challenges of using the content management system in the cloud after surveying many Content Management System related article and proposed an integrated solution named Cloud based Architecture integrating Content Management System which is capable of interfacing with various unique features available at different content management system installations in the cloud. This maximizes the functionality and performance of any Content management systems. The Representational State Transfer (REST) protocol is used to integrate the best features of various open source content management systems. REST provides higher level of security compared to existing systems as it does not store the user sessions.
