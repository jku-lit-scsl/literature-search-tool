"A Secure and Reliable Platform Configuration Change Reporting Mechanism for Trusted Computing Enhanced Secure Channels","K. Dietrich","Microcomputing Laboratory, Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz, Austria","2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","12 Dec 2008","2008","","","2137","2142","The security of well established secure channel technologies like transport layer security (TLS) or IP security (IPSec) can be significantly improved by emerging concepts like trusted computing. The use of trusted platform modules (TPMs) offers new methods for improving the security of these well established technologies. How secure channel technologies can be adapted to use trusted computing concepts is subject to current research. A major part of this research addresses the integration of the TCG's specified remote attestation. Remote attestation enables a platform to provide a trustworthy proof of its current configuration (i.e. software that has been loaded on the platform). Hence, based on this proof, a remote platform can decide whether to open a channel to another platform or not. In current approaches, the proof of the platform configuration is processed before a secure channel is established, which is not opened if the reported configuration is not accepted by the hosts. However, one important problem has not been solved yet. Currently, no satisfying solution how the change of a platform's configuration can be securely and reliably reported to the remote platform whilst a channel is open, exists. A reliable method to provide a proof for a configuration change can be implemented with only minor modifications of the TPM specification and the TLS protocol. Experimental results show that it is possible to implement this proof mechanism with only a few additional TPM commands.","","978-0-7695-3398-8","10.1109/ICYCS.2008.530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4709304","Trusted computing;platform configuration reporting;secure channels;TLS","Information security;Computer security;Protocols;Proposals;Cryptography;Information processing;Laboratories;Information retrieval;Certification","computer network reliability;cryptographic protocols;IP networks;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;transport protocols","reliable platform configuration change reporting mechanism;trusted computing;secure channel technology;transport layer security;IP security;trusted platform module;TLS protocol;TPM specification;cryptographic protocol","","1","1","14","IEEE","12 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Complete decoupling between real and reactive power flows is assumed, and coordination between the real and reactive power control variables is used to eliminate any type of constraint violations. The problem is linearized using simplified and constant sensitivity relationships, and the optimal solution is obtained using dual simplex linear programming with a relaxation technique.

With the ending of the Cold War and the realignment of world power, resources once available for security concerns have scaled back or eliminated. As manpower allocations are reduced, new approaches are necessary to compensate for this loss. In addition, with the shift from superpower confrontation to local/regional conflict, response assets have become highly mobile. This creates a new requirement for the physical protection of those items. In response to these changes, Racon Inc. has successfully commercialized a physical security sensor addressing these issues. Easily installed by unskilled personnel, these sensors utilize advanced technology to compensate for reduced manpower levels.

Along with raising the number of novel attacks, many types of countermeasures have taken place to stop them. One of the most efficient methods to stop network attacks is using IDS/IPS Systems. The ultimate goal of an IDPS system is to stop security attacks before they have been carried successfully. This paper proposed an efficient network-based IDPS System which takes multiple counteractions against network attacks. The proposed system's first reaction after detecting malicious packets is to generate an alert and log them; if the number of packets goes beyond threshold limit in one second, the second counteraction takes place to block the attackers IP address through firewall. Finally, if the system fails to block these packets, the third counteraction takes place to remotely stop the corresponding service. In this case the system prevents an attack from being successfully carried.","","978-1-5090-3294-5","10.1109/ICIIECS.2017.8276023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8276023","IDS;IPS system;Network security;Network attack prevention;Intrusion Prevention System;NIDPS","IP networks;Databases;Firewalls (computing);Ports (Computers);Web servers","firewalls;Internet;IP networks","firewall;network-based IDPS system;network-based intrusion detection;information security;ultimate goal;IDS/IPS Systems;mobile systems;multimode counteractions;prevention system;attackers IP address;counteraction;malicious packets;network attacks;multiple counteractions;security attacks","","6","","18","IEEE","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventionally, the security level provided by such protocol cannot be modified according to the status of the network. In this paper, we propose a security-aware scheduling algorithm for a heterogeneous packet switched network. It provides real-time packet flows with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) while adaptively controls the packet's confidentiality security service level. The proposed scheme is modeled using the object-oriented multi-agent methodology. By applying a buffer estimation technique at the network's end nodes, the algorithm provides a real-time network congestion control hence satisfying the network performance metrics. In order to minimize the overhead of network association performed by the IPsec, the algorithm overloads the priority code point fields of the IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame format. This approach helps meet both QoS and security requirements for real-time data flows.","1938-1883","978-1-4577-2053-6","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364459","","Security;Real-time systems;Protocols;Quality of service;Servers;Delay;Object oriented modeling","adaptive control;Internet;multi-agent systems;quality of service;real-time systems;scheduling;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security","object-oriented multiagent methodology;adaptive security-aware scheduling;Internet protocol security;IPsec;real-time IP packets;heterogeneous packet switched network;real-time packet flows;quality of service;QoS;adaptive control;packet confidentiality security service level;buffer estimation;real-time network congestion control;network association overhead;priority code point fields;IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame format","","1","","8","IEEE","29 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this talk I propose the use of Bigraphical Reactive Systems to represent the topology of cyber and physical spaces. I describe how to use this representation to reason about the consequences of the evolution of topological configurations on the satisfaction of security requirements. I also illustrate a planning technique to identify an adaptation strategy to be used at runtime, to circumvent, prevent, or mitigate security requirements violations previously identified.

Security agents, such as cops, use public camera footage to track down the accused's movements. People are assigned to this responsibility of watching the public camera recordings. These individuals must constantly watch the detected faces and compare them to the accused faces. However, because this is a continual process, there is a high risk of manual errors when utilizing this method. The accused person's face can also be discovered using this method, but by the time the assigned person tells the nearest police station, the accused person may have left/escaped. With all of these considerations in mind, it is necessary to avoid these blunders. Manual mistake in determining the perpetrator's face and relaying the information to officials swiftly are the main problems. Installing a camera with an already supplied data collection of suspected people can help cross-check the detected faces with the uploaded data set, which is the first issue. This improves the precision of the accused's detection. The second issue is telling officials about the suspected criminal or accused in a timely manner. If the installed camera has a transmitting unit, with the receiver on the official side and the transmitter on the camera end, this will work. The information is swiftly transmitted to the authorities, and there is a good possibility that the perpetrator will be apprehended. A frequency band is fundamental for any transmission to actually occur. The frequency ranges essential for the above-mentioned transferring data are 400–500 Hz and 900–1000 Hz.

The deployment of static security services will consume the energy even if it is not required in some situations, so this induces a waste of resources. In this paper, we introduce an efficient model for adaptive security in the IoT based on trust management. Most of existing adaptive security approaches lack of practical means to evaluate threats. On the other hand, trust management systems are designed to deal with selfish behaviors or internal attacks and not to assist cryptographic measures. Our solution evaluates the trust level related to the presence of security threats among nodes, and adapt consequently cryptographic measures. The obtained simulation results show that our solution reduces considerably energy consumption and remains yet secure.","","978-1-5090-2054-6","10.1109/LCN.2016.101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7796850","Internet of Things (IoT);Adaptive security;Trust management","Security;Adaptation models;Trust management;Mathematical models;Authentication;Cryptography;Behavioral sciences","computer network security;Internet of Things;trusted computing","TAS-IoT;trust-based adaptive security;IoT;Internet of Things;trust management systems;security threats;energy consumption","","17","","10","IEEE","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The scheme has self- and context-awareness in addition to a holistic view of security services at each layer of the communication stack. It uses distributed agents and intrusion detection systems to monitor the security threats and then dynamically adapts its security level by jointly considering several dimensions. This translates into optimal security-energy under a given resource and context. The key dimensions are energy budget, computing power and memory size of nodes, location-based security threat levels, data coherence, and data lifetime.

It is now normal for performance and availability of such systems to be carefully measured and evaluated. Contracts that include financial penalties in case of breach are now common. However security is lagging behind this trend; it is as important to stakeholders as performance and availability, but is generally not included in the scope of service-level agreements between stakeholders, and handled instead on a best-effort basis, without any transparency nor SLA with their clients. One reason for this is the difficulty of objectively measuring security. Indeed, the actual security level of a system is dependent on a wide range of factors, some intrinsic to the system - such as a design or implementation mistake resulting in a vulnerability - and some extrinsic to it. For instance, an external event such as the publication of a vulnerability in an open-source software dependency or a change of political context in a country can widely impact the risks faced by an information system even if no actual change were made to the system. These factors are even more numerous in multi-tenant cloud infrastructures because of the sheer number of actors involved - and their sometimes conflicting incentives - and opportunities for both attack and defense at scale. Security monitoring aims to detect and react to attacks in real time; Reactive security monitoring intends to take external events into account while doing so. Improving the accuracy of a system's overall security assessment can help transitioning security to a SLA paradigm and enable better transparency for all stakeholders.","","978-1-5386-5175-9","10.1109/FAS-W.2018.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599521","Security;Cloud;SLA;IDS","Security;Software;Cloud computing;Information systems;Prototypes;Monitoring;Contracts","cloud computing;contracts;public domain software;security of data","multitenant cloud;external event;security assessment;transparency;adaptive security monitoring;cloud computing;service-level agreements;information systems stakeholders;financial penalties;best-effort basis;actual security level;open-source software dependency;information system;actual change;reactive security monitoring","","2","","17","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, the phase profiles, channel capacity and received power of OAM beams are analyzed in terms of various system parameters in oblique scenarios at 30GHz. Thirdly, we discussed the security of the proposed OAM wiretap system. The results show that the system using vortex waves is superior to conventional communication systems using planar electromagnetic waves in terms of system security due to the inherent divergence and spiral phase structure of OAM beams. Moreover, we found that the distortion of OAM beams during transmission and the center shift at receiving end will occur and that system is more stable for high-mode OAM propagation in oblique scenarios.

A security meta-model has been developed in which the traditional role concept has been extended. The new concept incorporates the need of both security management as used by role-based access control (RBAC) and agent functional behaviour in agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE). Our approach avoids weaknesses of traditional RBAC approaches and provides a practically usable security model for multi-agent systems (MAS). A unified role interaction model framework has been put forward that incorporates not only functional requirements but also security constraints in MAS.

The major contribution of the work is that little redevelopment effort will be required when security is to be engineered into the overall MAS architecture, hence minimising the impact of the security requirements changes to the MAS architecture.

Engineering adaptive security is not an easy task. A set of effective security countermeasures should be identified. These countermeasures should not only be applied to (primary) assets that customers desire to protect, but also to other (secondary) assets that can be exploited by attackers to harm the primary assets. Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions. Third, the paper illustrates our approach through a set of adaptive security scenarios in the customer domain of a smart grid. We suggest that modeling secondary assets aids the deployment of countermeasures, and, in combination with a representation of assets variability, facilitates the design of monitoring functions.","2157-2321","978-1-4673-1787-0","10.1109/SEAMS.2012.6224403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224403","Adaptive security;Smart grid;Assets;Adaptive software","Security;Home appliances;Smart grids;Cameras;Monitoring;Buildings;Energy management","asset management;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","valuable asset management;security control;security countermeasures;primary assets;engineering adaptive security requirement;secondary assets;customer domain;smart grid;asset variability;monitoring function","","4","","8","IEEE","25 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have argued that incorporating an explicit representation of the environment's topology enables reasoning on the location of assets being protected and the proximity of potentially harmful agents. This paper proposes to engineer topology aware adaptive security systems by identifying violations of security requirements that may be caused by topological changes, and selecting a set of security controls that prevent such violations. Our approach focuses on physical topologies; it maintains at runtime a live representation of the topology which is updated when assets or agents move, or when the structure of the physical space is altered. When the topology changes, we look ahead at a subset of the future system states. These states are reachable when the agents move within the physical space. If security requirements can be violated in future system states, a configuration of security controls is proactively applied to prevent the system from reaching those states. Thus, the system continuously adapts to topological stimuli, while maintaining requirements satisfaction. Security requirements are formally expressed using a propositional temporal logic, encoding spatial properties in Computation Tree Logic (CTL). The Ambient Calculus is used to represent the topology of the operational environment - including location of assets and agents - as well as to identify future system states that are reachable from the current one. The approach is demonstrated and evaluated using a substantive example concerned with physical access control.","2332-6441","978-1-4799-3033-3","10.1109/RE.2014.6912262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912262","","Security;Topology;Buildings;Calculus;Aerospace electronics;Servers;Runtime","authorisation;data flow analysis;formal specification;temporal logic","topology aware adaptive security engineering;requirements violation prevention;adaptive security systems;potentially harmful agents;security requirements;security controls;propositional temporal logic;encoding spatial properties;computation tree logic;ambient calculus;access control","","21","","24","IEEE","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CA studies the impact of equipment outage on the system. This paper presents the dynamic contingency redefinition in power system security analysis. Contingency definition is usually accomplished in an off-line development environment. The pre-defined contingency cases are studied in the off-line or on-line contingency analysis program. Usually the contingency definition defines hypothetical equipment outage or fault. It does not explicitly specify the isolating breakers of the fault. The dynamic contingency re-definition takes into account the actual response of protection subsystem to the equipment outage. It identifies the breakers required for isolating the contingency equipment. This provides additional accuracy of post contingency results to ensure the analysis accuracy and the remedial action schemes emulated correctly. Each re-defined contingency is simulated in CA by opening these breakers to evaluate their impact on the system. The ability to respect the status of manually operated switches is important to ensure the simulation mimics protection schemes. Any non-contingency equipment forced out as a result of these breaker openings will be added to the contingency equipment list.

Biometrics, due to their uniqueness and accuracy are now widely used for authentication and identification. However unimodal biometrics has certain limitations. To overcome the problems in unimodal biometrics and to increase the level of security multimodal biometrics is used. Multimodal biometrics is of different types, multi algorithmic, multi instance and multi sensorial. This paper introduces a new personal identification framework that is based on the fusion of face and fingerprint biometrics. Face is being processed using two algorithms, Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce the recognition error. After being processed by LDA, output of LDA is provided to PCA. Then fingerprint is processed using crossing number based method. Finally output from PCA and fingerprint are combined using matching score based on sum rule. Experimental results performed on a given database of face and fingerprint images shows that the proposed framework improved greatly the security and recognition rate.","","978-1-5090-4257-9","10.1109/ICOEI.2017.8300965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8300965","Biometrics;LDA;PCA;Crossing number method","Fingerprint recognition;Principal component analysis;Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Security;Training","authorisation;biometrics (access control);face recognition;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;principal component analysis","personal authentication;conventional security systems;unimodal biometrics;personal identification framework;fingerprint biometrics;PCA;multimodal biometric security;face biometrics;linear discriminant analysis;principal component analysis","","","","12","IEEE","22 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the support of the offline optimal secure protocol selection module and the online self-adaptive security control module, the framework is capable of deploying different combinations of secure protocols to satisfy different security needs in different conditions for different applications. Consequently, the proposed self-adaptive security provisioning achieves the maximum overall network security services and network performance services, without causing an SPDoS attack.

Firstly, a state observer is constructed to mitigate the impact of sensor attacks. And then neural networks are used to approximate the nonlinear term and compensate for state-dependent actuator attacks. Finally, in order to reduce the impact of FDI attacks, we design a special time-varying symmetry barrier function in backstepping control design, which can achieve specific output signal constraints under FDI attacks.

We propose a newly designed framework for Modular Addition over field GF(2) satisfying the algebraic properties of regular Modular Addition 2n albeit with cumulative security enhancements and increased complexity to address these challenges. Nevertheless, it has been observed that the complexity of Modular Addition can be drastically decreased with the appropriate formulation of polynomial equations and probabilistic conditions. In this article we propose a new extended design framework for advanced Modular Addition and it is characterized by user-specified extendable security which does not impose additional changes in existing layout of ciphers including both stream and block ciphers. This framework can be rapidly scaled to use-specific requirements which boosts the algebraic degree of the overall structure. This, in turn it thwarts the probabilistic conditions by retaining the original hardware complexity sans critical modifications of Modular Addition 2n.","","978-1-908320-73-5","10.1109/ICITST.2016.7856683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7856683","Algebraic Cryptanalysis;Addition Modulo;Algebraic Degree;Scalability;SNOW2.0;TRIVIUM;S-Box;IDEA;AES;LFSR;NFSR;SAT solver;Stream Cipher;Block Cipher","Ciphers;Complexity theory;Mathematical model;Internet;Input variables","computational complexity;cryptography;formal logic;polynomials;probability","adaptive security framework;extensible computational complexity;cipher systems;algebraic cryptanalysis;algebraic tools;cryptosystems;modular addition;logic exclusive-OR;security threats;polynomial equations;probabilistic conditions;hardware complexity","","1","","15","","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of its most valuable features is its threat detection function which is available on every version of the firewall running a software version of 8.0(2) or higher. Threat detection operates at layers 3 and 4 to determine a baseline for network traffic, analysing packet drop statistics and generating threat reports based on traffic patterns. Despite producing a large volume of statistical information relating to several security events, further effort is required to mine and visually report more significant information and conclude the security status of the network. There are several commercial off-the-shelf tools available to undertake this task, however, they are expensive and may require a cloud subscription. Furthermore, if the information transmitted over the network is sensitive or requires confidentiality, the involvement of a third party or a third-party tool may place organisational security at risk. Therefore, this paper presents a fuzzy logic aided intelligent threat detection solution, which is a cost-free, intuitive and comprehensible solution, enhancing and simplifying the threat detection process for all. In particular, it employs a fuzzy reasoning system based on the threat detection statistics, and presents results/threats through a developed dashboard user interface, for ease of understanding for administrators and users. The paper further demonstrates the successful utilisation of a fuzzy reasoning system for selected and prioritised security events in basic threat detection, although it can be extended to encompass more complex situations, such as complete basic threat detection, advanced threat detection, scanning threat detection, and customised feature based threat detection.","","978-1-5090-6020-7","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2018.8491574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491574","","Firewalls (computing);Feature extraction;Fuzzy logic;Tools;Monitoring;Fuzzy reasoning","computer crime;firewalls;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;organisational aspects;user interfaces","organisational networks;valuable features;threat detection function;software version;network traffic;analysing packet drop statistics;traffic patterns;statistical information;significant information;security status;third-party tool;organisational security;fuzzy logic;intelligent threat detection solution;comprehensible solution;threat detection process;fuzzy reasoning system;threat detection statistics;prioritised security events;complete basic threat detection;advanced threat detection;customised feature based threat detection;Cisco adaptive security appliance 5500 series firewall","","15","","28","Crown","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Distinct from the previous approaches in this field, our scheme not only efficiently realizes access control over encrypted data in a fine-grained and revocable way but also is proved to be adaptively secure under standard decision linear assumption. Meanwhile, the parameters do not need to be predefined in the system initialization and thus, our scheme satisfies the unbounded property. Moreover, the monotonic span program (MSP) is elegantly utilized as the access structure to reduce the number of bilinear pairing and exponentiation operations for encryption and decryption.

This growth has made the present day systems very big and complex. The complexity is arising especially due to many Interconnections, different types of loads and larger generating units. Also there is uncertainty in load forecasting. With EHV interconnections the disturbances are felt even in geographically distant parts of the system, increasing the severity of the disturbances. These factors make the satisfactory operating of the system a more difficult task. Added to this, Society is becoming more dependent on electric power; and it is essential to make the power available to customers without any interruption and within certain limits of voltage and frequency variations. This means that there is a great need to ensure that a system is as economical, reliable and secure as possible [1]. High reliability of the system is usually obtained by following the principles of bulk power supply planning. However, due to delay in commissioning of new plants and equipment, equipment outages, unexpected load demands and disturbances, the system may be forced to operate in or close to critical and emergency conditions. Hence, in addition to sophisticated planning and designing of the system, an effective operation and control of power systems is essential. The maintenance of a system in a reliable and secure mode is becoming an Important part of the Job of the operators. In the past, more emphasis was given to economic operation; but in view of the consequences of power failures, reliable and secure operation of the system is being given more importance. Security assessment deals with the tracking of the system and deciding whether the present state is secure or not. If the system's state is found to be insecure, it forewarns the operator to take possible remedial action or to be ready for the disturbance if it takes place. This is done before any disturbance (which may lead to failure or deterioration in the quality of supply) occurS. Thus security evaluation is essentially an on-line procedure. The paper will discuss the different operating states of a power system, system security and different approaches for transient security assessment. Recent research results applying the pattern recognition approach will be summarized and presented.","","","10.1109/CDC.1975.270572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4045489","","Power system security;Pattern recognition;Power system reliability;Power system interconnection;Power system planning;Power system economics;Power generation economics;Economic forecasting;Power system control;Power system transients","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identifying and evaluating assets are therefore key activities in any security engineering process - from modeling threats and attacks, discovering existing vulnerabilities, to selecting appropriate countermeasures. However, despite their crucial role, assets are often neglected during the development of secure software systems. Indeed, many systems are designed with fixed security boundaries and assumptions, without the possibility to adapt when assets change unexpectedly, new threats arise, or undiscovered vulnerabilities are revealed. To handle such changes, systems must be capable of dynamically enabling different security countermeasures. This paper promotes assets as first-class entities in engineering secure software systems. An asset model is related to requirements, expressed through a goal model, and the objectives of an attacker, expressed through a threat model. These models are then used as input to build a causal network to analyze system security in different situations, and to enable, when necessary, a set of countermeasures to mitigate security threats. The causal network is conceived as a runtime entity that tracks relevant changes that may arise at runtime, and enables a new set of countermeasures. We illustrate and evaluate our proposed approach by applying it to a substantive example concerned with security of mobile phones.","2332-6441","978-1-4673-2785-5","10.1109/RE.2012.6345794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345794","Security requirements;Adaptation;Causal reasoning","Security;Adaptation models;Runtime;Mobile handsets;Credit cards;Analytical models;Usability","security of data;software engineering;systems analysis","requirements-driven adaptive security;security engineering process;secure software systems;undiscovered vulnerabilities;security countermeasures;secure software engineering systems;variable asset protection","","43","","25","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system security constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all possible operating modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other words, these boundaries form the feasible operating domain - in the parameter space spanned by various operating variables - within which the system can safely be operated. For a given operating scenario, the associated security level is measured by the “distance” (for example, the Euclidean norm) of the operating point from the security region boundary. This paper reports on the results of a recently completed research and development paper, which included the development of innovative computerized schemes, which are capable of identifying dynamic operating security modes during the on-line operation of electric power systems. The methodology adopted in this paper includes the development of advanced, highly efficient computerized algorithms for fast identification of dynamic operating security modes of power systems. One of the salient outcomes of this paper is the development of a novel framework for identification and representation of operating security regions in power systems as well as evaluation of security levels associated with different operating scenarios. While the concepts and principles presented are general, the work of this paper is confined to the interpretation of the security boundary in terms of system stability criteria.

The former issues are typically addressed by optimizing key factors, such as iris size, image quality and acquisition wavelength. As for the latter, introducing error correction codes to reduce intra-user variability in the enrolled identifiers becomes novelly promising. This paper proposes a conventional iris authentication system and a hardware-friendly QC-LDPC error correction code scheme on a microprocessor-FPGA platform. Different QC-LDPC codes in IEEE 802.16e were analyzed and selected. Suitable codes were applied, followed by the evaluation experiments. The proposed design achieves a competitive result with up to 0.20% EER and 0.50% ZeroFAR on the CASIA-IrisV4-Syn database. Cryptographic keys with lengths of up to 288 bits can also be generated and recovered. Such a device can be potentially used for applications such as an access control system in high-security areas, identity verification at the borders, biometric cryptography and related authentication scenarios.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3133908","Exploration Squared Limited (ES Ltd.), New Zealand; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9642996","Iris authentication;biometric;error correction codes;LDPC;QC-LDPC;FPGA;dynamic partial reconfiguration","Iris recognition;Codes;Biometrics (access control);Field programmable gate arrays;Error correction codes;Authentication;Decoding","biometrics (access control);cryptography;error correction codes;field programmable gate arrays;image coding;iris recognition;microprocessor chips;parity check codes","IEEE 802.16e;CASIA-IrisV4-Syn database;cryptographic keys;access control system;related authentication scenarios;effective multimode iris authentication system;microprocessor-FPGA heterogeneous platform;iris biometrics;iris authentication systems;corresponding variability reduction methods;iris size;image quality;acquisition wavelength;error correction codes;intra-user variability;enrolled identifiers;conventional iris authentication system;hardware-friendly QC-LDPC error correction code scheme;microprocessor-FPGA platform;QC-LDPC codes;storage capacity 288.0 bit","","1","","49","CCBY","8 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the scientific, technical, industrial, business, and social worlds have changed from physically isolated systems to electronically interconnected system-of-systems (SoS), the functioning of such a SoS depends critically on its operational robustness and security. In the previous physically-isolated world, robust static security for selected matched problems was often sufficient. Today, we need a new approach to providing security, because even adaptive security is insufficient. This new approach is termed here a cognitive security system. The talk will cover three major issues. First, the talk starts from a review of the existing security systems, with their problems and required solutions, as well as their vulnerabilities, attacks, and defences. Second, it provides a review of decision-making systems, including dynamic and dynamical systems, complex systems, adaptive systems, autonomic systems and their attributes, symbiotic systems, and finally special attention is given to cognitive dynamic systems as defined by Wang's cognitive informatics [1-4], Kinsner cognitive machines, [5], Haikonen conscious machines [6], and Haykin cognitive dynamic systems [7]. This review ends with a model of cognitive security system. This model has a feature based on polyscale analysis and synthesis never reported before. Finally, examples of security-related cognitive static and dynamic systems developed in our research group are presented, including wavelet-packet fingerprint compression for data mining, watermarking and steganography, a new chaotic cryptography system, and new polyscale analysis for SmartGrid2.","","978-1-4673-2795-4","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2012.6311207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6311207","","Security;Cognitive informatics;Computers;Educational institutions;Robustness;Computational intelligence","chaos;cognitive systems;cryptography;data mining;grid computing;steganography;water quality;watermarking","cognitive security systems;scientific worlds;technical worlds;industrial worlds;business worlds;social worlds;physically isolated systems;electronically interconnected system-of-systems;SoS;operational robustness;physically-isolated world;robust static security;selected matched problems;decision-making systems;dynamical systems;complex systems;adaptive systems;autonomic systems;symbiotic systems;Wang cognitive informatics;Kinsner cognitive machines;Haikonen conscious machines;Haykin cognitive dynamic systems;polyscale analysis;security-related cognitive static systems;wavelet-packet fingerprint compression;data mining;watermarking;steganography;chaotic cryptography system;SmartGrid2","","16","","7","IEEE","24 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In real time environment, data-base may be created by keeping the record of operating states by state estimation. The severity of contingency for each case with respect to different contingencies (single line outages) is assessed by number of secure and insecure operating states, which is predicted by CBR. Security classes are defined by threshold value of maximum loadability margins, calculated using the continuation power flow analysis.

However, potential merits of hardware-based solutions to further secure application exposure have not been considered so far. This paper describes a method for combining software resource level security features offered by Web services technologies, with the hardware-based security mechanisms offered by trusted computing platform and system virtualisation approaches. In particular, we propose trust-based architecture for protecting the enforcement middleware deployed at the policy enforcement endpoints of Web and grid services.

In theory, there are two main objectives that could be considered, namely the maximization of system security and the minimization of total operating cost of supplying energy. In practice, however, the security requirements are included as constraints rather than formulating the problem as a security maximization mandate. The system security constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all possible operating modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other words, these boundaries form the feasible operating domain in the parameter space spanned by various operating variables within which the system can safely be operated. For a given operating scenario, the associated security level is measured by the ""distance"" (for example, the Euclidean norm) of the operating point from the security region boundary. This paper presents a novel framework for identification and representation of operating security regions in power systems as well as evaluation of security levels associated with different operating scenarios. While the concepts and principles presented are general, the work of this the paper is confined to the interpretation of the security boundary in terms of system stability criteria. Of course, the framework presented is applicable quite as well to other criteria that may be considered.","","978-1-4244-5087-9","10.1109/NSS.2009.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319315","Power system operation;Security regions;System stability;Operating constraints","Power system security;Power system dynamics;Power system stability;Power system reliability;Costs;Information security;Steady-state;Power transmission lines;Power system modeling;Stability criteria","cost reduction;minimisation;power system reliability;power system security","power system operating security region boundary identification framework;reliable secure electricity supply;operation cost minimization;system security maximization mandate;energy supply;Euclidean norm","","5","","16","IEEE","10 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we analyze the security guarantees that used to defend against physical attacks, and make the observation that heterogeneous GPU memory system may not always need all the security mechanisms to achieve the security guarantees. Based on the memory types as well as memory access patterns either explicitly specified in the GPU programming model or implicitly detected at run time, we propose adaptive security memory support for heterogeneous memory on GPUs. Specifically, we first identify the read-only data and propose to only use MAC (Message Authentication Code) to protect their integrity. By eliminating the freshness checks on read-only data, we can use an on-chip shared counter for such data regions and remove the corresponding parts in the Bonsai Merkel Tree (BMT), thereby reducing the traffic due to encryption counters and the BMT. Second, we detect the common streaming data access pattern and propose coarse- grain MACs for such stream data to reduce the MAC access bandwidth. With the hardware-based detection of memory type (read-only or not) and memory access patterns (streaming or not), our proposed approach adapts the security support to significantly reduce the performance overhead without sacrificing the security guarantees. Our evaluation shows that our scheme can achieve secure memory on GPUs with low overheads for memory-intensive workloads. Among the fifteen memory-intensive workloads in our evaluation, our design reduces the performance overheads of secure GPU memory from 53.9% to 8.09% on average. Compared to the state-of- the-art secure memory designs for GPU [17], [33], our scheme outperforms PSSM by up to 41.63% and 9.5% on average and outperforms Common counters by 84.04% on average for memory-intensive workloads. We further propose to use the L2 cache as a victim cache for security metadata when the L2 is either underutilized or suffers from very high miss rates, which further reduces the overheads by up to 4% and 0.65% on average.","2378-203X","978-1-6654-2027-3","10.1109/HPCA53966.2022.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773192","GPUs;secure memory;heterogeneous memory;encryption;integrity check;security metadata cache","Graphics processing units;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Metadata;Programming;Hardware;System-on-chip","cache storage;cryptography;graphics processing units;message authentication;multiprocessing systems","adaptive security support;CPU secure memory design;memory bandwidth contention;regular data;security metadata;security guarantees;heterogeneous GPU memory system;memory access patterns;GPU programming model;adaptive security memory support;read-only data;common streaming data access pattern;stream data;MAC access bandwidth;hardware-based detection;memory-intensive workloads;secure GPU memory;physical attack;message authentication code;on-chip shared counter;Bonsai Merkel Tree;BMT;L2 cache","","4","","34","IEEE","17 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A system may be capable of operating within constraints but may not be able to withstand outages, even single level. A risk index designated as CSOSR (composite system operating state risk) has been defined and the utilization of this CSOSR for a simple system expansion plan has been demonstrated.

We utilise such models to perform speculative threat analysis through model checking to reason about the consequences of the evolution of topological configurations on the satisfaction of security requirements.

Therefore, the selection of security activities must be based on the priority of the criteria and adaptive. This paper addresses the adaptive security activities selection model as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) issue. Analytic Network Process (ANP) is proposed for weight calculation and criteria prioritization. Hypothetical examples were presented based on hard constraints faced by in-house web-based application development team in two different scenarios. The Decision Maker made the judgement by using the online ASAS model. The results show that experience, skill and knowledge get the highest priority in the first scenario while budget/ cost get the highest priority in the second scenario.

With increase in load, the power system network is loaded to its limits, making it susceptible to collapse even under minor disturbances. In order to operate the power system economically, the current operating state of the system must be identified as either secure or insecure. An artificial neural network (ANN) aided method for security assessment is proposed and illustrated for a model six-bus power system. The work demonstrates the feasibility of classification of load patterns for power system static security assessment using a Kohonen self-organizing feature map. The most important aspect of this network is its generalization property. Using 15 different line-loading patterns for training, the network successfully classifies the unknown loading patterns.

This paper focuses on the second stage of the automated process, the identity verification, based on the biometric data available in the electronic travel document. According to the nature of the travel document, a standardized facial image (1st and 2nd generation electronic Passport, Spanish electronic ID card), two standardized fingerprint images (2nd generation electronic Passport) or fingerprint Match-on-Card features (Spanish electronic ID card) are available. While the facial image can be considered the de facto standard biometric modality for ABC systems, fingerprint availability allows for security enhancement and false rejection rates improvement.","","978-0-7695-5062-6","10.1109/EISIC.2013.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657182","Automated Border Control;electronic passport;multi-biometric;multi-modal;biometric fusion","Fingerprint recognition;Security;Europe;Face;Image matching;Iris recognition;Standards","face recognition;fingerprint identification;government data processing;sensor fusion","false rejection rates improvement;security enhancement;fingerprint availability;de facto standard biometric modality;fingerprint match-on-card features;standardized fingerprint images;standardized facial image;border crossing eligibility;background checks;document holder identity verification;electronic travel document;Spanish automated border control;traveller biometric identity verification;ABC systems;multimodal biometric fusion implementation","","9","","6","IEEE","7 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant strategies for CGRAs apply either temporal or spatial scheme, including redundancy, periodic detection, workload balancing, and reconfiguration, failing to exploit the feature of dynamic and partial reconfiguration of CGRAs. Also, vulnerable judging circuits and inflexible mode shifting bottleneck the reliability design of fault-tolerant CGRAs. This paper proposes a novel multi-mode fault-tolerant framework for CGRAs, which combines spatial-redundant data-paths with temporal-redundant voters and thus reduces the vulnerable judging circuits while balancing the performance and reliability. This framework can also enable a changing reliability level at runtime via an online configuration transformation method based on pre-compiled patterns. Within the proposed framework, we systematically searched the design space spanning various combinations of the mainstream schemes with a Markov process model to compare the effectiveness and accordingly selected five points as available modes in our design after comprehensive consideration of fault tolerance and time overhead on CGRA. The framework is comprehensively evaluated on a cycle-accurate CGRA simulator, considering both permanent and transient faults. The experimental results show that the fault coverage rate of single transient faults or permanent faults has increased from 71.74% to 93.84%, which means the fault tolerance of the system has been increased by 31.03% compared with the state-of-the-art methods. There is also a great improvement in mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) and reconfiguration latency over baseline designs.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2023.3239563","2022-XXXX-ZD-005-00(grant numbers:2022-XXXX-ZD-005-00); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61834002); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3100903); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025362","CGRA;dynamic compilation;TMR;reliability;fault-tolerant design","Fault tolerant systems;Redundancy;Circuit faults;Reliability;Reliability engineering;Detectors;Field programmable gate arrays","","","","","","","IEEE","24 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The method not only classifies system operating conditions into a secure/insecure state but for an insecure operating state it also identifies the pertinent failure modes. The knowledge about the system operating conditions (patterns) are stored in a structured memory by grouping similar patterns into clusters which are then arranged into a hierarchical tree structure. This permits a fast two level search for the nearest neighbor. For patterns near the separating region of secure and insecure patterns a fuzzy estimation technique is used to provide an error-free security assessment.<>","","","10.1109/TENCON.1989.177087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=177087","","Pattern recognition;Power system security;Power system measurements;Voltage;Power generation;Power measurement;Data security;Information security;Power system reliability;Tree data structures","pattern recognition;power system control","hierarchical clustering;pattern recognition method;power system security assessment;operating condition patterns;fuzzy estimation","","3","","8","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A variety of biometrics are being used, such as finger sensors and digital signatures. A multimodal biometric system combines more traits and provides maximum accuracy in authenticating the users. The aim of this survey is to delineate the importance of using multimodal biometrics. Getting illegitimate access in unimodal biometric systems is easy, but multimodal biometric systems need more effort to break into the system. A digital biometric system works on the physiological and behavioural characteristics of an individual. It determines identification through automated technology. Many companies are investing large amounts in multimodal biometric systems and they are mostly being used in IoT devices for security purposes. An economy based on digital computing technologies is a digital economy and multimodal biometric systems are enhancing it.

Although a number of parallel disk systems have been developed, the systems lack a means to optimize quality of security for dynamically changing networked environments. We remedy this situation by proposing an adaptive quality of security control scheme for networked parallel disk systems (or ASPAD for short) that makes it possible for networked disk systems to adapt to changing security requirements and workload conditions. ASPAD is carried out in three phases: dynamic data partitioning, response time estimation, and adaptive security quality control. Hence, ASPAD is conducive to adaptively and expeditiously determining security schemes for disk requests in a way to improve security of networked parallel disk systems while making an effort to guarantee desired response times of the requests. To prove the efficiency of the proposed approach, we simulate a networked parallel disk system into which nine cryptographic schemes are integrated. Empirical results show that ASPAD significantly improves overall performance over an existing strategy with an average of 65%.","1095-2055","1-4244-0572-6","10.1109/ICCCN.2006.286319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067700","","Programmable control;Adaptive control;Control systems;Data security;Cryptography;Delay;Secure storage;Parallel processing;Protection;Automatic control","quality control;security of data","adaptive quality;security control;networked parallel disk systems;dynamic data partitioning;response time estimation;adaptive security quality control;cryptographic schemes","","1","","11","IEEE","22 Jan 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems have greater advantages over traditional systems that are difficult to break and provide good anti-spoofing abilities. Use of these systems has increased in recent years owing to the increasing trend of thefts, breaking of security systems, hacking and another means of unauthorized access. In this paper a multimodal recognition algorithm using palm print and palm vein images. The palm print image is rich in line features as it consists of wrinkles, ridges and principal lines. On the other hand the palm vein image contains rich texture features in the form of blood vessel patterns also called as vein patterns. A multimodal identification system has been proposed in this paper which uses Contourlet transform to analyze the features present in palm print and palm vein images. The proposed algorithm captures local minutae and a global feature from a palm print and palm vein images and stores them as a compact code. After extraction of the ROI from the source images the (2-D) image spectrum is divided into fine sub-components (called subbands) using iterated directional filter bank structure. The feature matching technique is then performed using Euclidean Distance algorithm. For this algorithm CASIA Palm print Database V1.0 is used.","2325-9418","978-1-4799-2275-8","10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726010","Biometrics;Contourlet transform;Palm print;palm vein;Euclidean distance","Veins;Feature extraction;Transforms;Gabor filters;Filter banks;Image resolution;Laplace equations","authorisation;channel bank filters;computer crime;discrete transforms;feature extraction;image matching;image texture;palmprint recognition;vein recognition;visual databases","antispoofing abilities;multimodal biometric recognition systems;multimodal recognition algorithm;palm print images;palm vein images;palm print features;palm vein features;line features;wrinkles;ridges;principal lines;texture features;blood vessel patterns;vein patterns;multimodal identification system;contourlet transform;local minutae;global feature;ROI extraction;source images;2-D image spectrum subcomponents;subbands;iterated directional filter bank structure;feature matching technique;Euclidean distance algorithm;CASIA palm print database V1.0","","8","","11","IEEE","30 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is used to forecast the operating states of a power system under one or more outages of generators, transmission lines, transformers, etc. To perform SSA, repetitive load flow analyses are required for obtaining the bus voltages, bus injections, and line flows considering each possible outage. A repetitive load flow analysis demands huge computational efforts like efficient system modelling for faster load flow solutions, parallel programming and High performance computing (HPC). In this paper, an N-1-1 CA has been analysed using fast decoupled load flow (FDLF) with a strategy of screening and ranking the catastrophic contingencies. This paper explores a computationally efficient method to analyze the severity and the ranking of N-1-1 contingencies for large power system SSA.

Analysis of the current operating state and prediction of plausible future insecurity is crucial for real-time decision-making and implementation of necessary control strategies to ensure secure operation of bulk power systems. On-line security assessment demands low complexity and computational time. The traditional methods of assessment of dynamic security of electric power systems often prove to be inadequate for online and real-time conditions due to their high complexity and long computation time. This article proposes a pattern recognition approach to dynamic security analysis for large and complex power systems using ensemble decision tree to form reliable decision rules for fast and accurate prediction of power system's operating states in a real-time and on-line environment. An ensemble security predictor (ENSP) was developed and trained to act as “dynamic security state predictor” to predict and classify power system's dynamic operating states into secure, insecure, and intermediate transitional classes. Two different case studies were performed on IEEE 118-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed method on systems of varying size and complexity. While prediction accuracy of some of the single-learner classifiers decreased considerably when implemented on a large sized system, the performance of ENSP declined marginally, and the results were acceptable for very large sized systems.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.2978504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9044298","Classification;dynamic security;ensemble decision tree;feature extraction;feature selection;pattern recognition;power system transient stability;prediction","Security;Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Decision trees;Real-time systems;Feature extraction;Training","decision making;decision trees;IEEE standards;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power engineering computing;power system security","ensemble security predictor;IEEE 300-bus systems;ensemble decision tree-based power system dynamic security state predictor;real-time decision-making;computational time;electric power system control;complex power systems;on-line security assessment;IEEE 118-bus system","","16","","25","IEEE","23 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper responds to this challenge and proposes an adaptive approach to defense randomization among the edge data centers via a stochastic game, whose solution corresponds to the optimal security deployment at the network's edge. Moreover, security risk is evaluated subjectively based on Prospect Theory to reflect realistic scenarios where the attacker and the edge system do not similarly perceive the status of the infrastructure. The results show that a non-deterministic defense policy yields better security compared to a static defense strategy.","","978-1-4503-8390-5","10.1145/3453142.3493511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9709022","Edge computing;risk mitigation;stochastic game;prospect theory;adaptive security","Performance evaluation;Wireless sensor networks;Privacy;Data centers;Games;Quality of service;Dynamic scheduling","cloud computing;computer centres;computer network security;game theory;risk management;security of data;stochastic games;telecommunication security","adaptive security risk mitigation;edge computing;randomized defense meets Prospect Theory;ubiquitous services;smart services;terminal devices;adaptive approach;defense randomization;edge data centers;optimal security deployment;edge system;nondeterministic defense policy yields better security;static defense strategy","","4","","21","","16 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Remote access to IEDs or user interfaces in a substation for maintenance purposes is a common practice. However, there are potential cyber-physical system vulnerabilities in a substation, e.g., unsecured standard protocols, remote controllable IEDs, and unauthorized remote access to substation IEDs. In addition, some substation IEDs and user interfaces have a web server and hence it may provide a remote configuration change and control with default passwords. Even if firewalls and cryptography schemes are used for cyber security, weak security key management cryptography and mis-configured firewalls are still exposed to intruders. From IT point of view, cyber security issues are well known and new security technologies are available. However, security research on the integration of IT and physical power systems for critical infrastructures is still an emerging area. Intruders behaviors will generate logs across all substation-level networks, e.g., IEDs, firewalls and user interfaces. For instance, the steps of Stuxnet attack are based on: (1) intrusion attempts, (2) change of the file system, (3) change of target systems setting, and (4) change of target systems status. Therefore, anomaly detection is performed based on logs of intruders foot prints. Temporal anomaly can be determined from discrepancies between event logs from two different time periods. In the proposed anomaly index, a value of 0 implies no difference, whereas 1 indicates the maximal discrepancy [1]. In order to identify the impact of substation cyber intrusion to the power grid, cyber intrusion scenarios have been conducted on the substation IT network using a SCADA testbed at University College Dublin (UCD). The first intrusion scenario involves compromised substation gateway. A false signal is generated and an open circuit breaker (CB) command is sent to substation CBs. The second scenario is to generate forged CB status at the gateway. As a result of this attack, control center operators will observe fake data about the CB status. However, the actual substation CBs status has not changed. The third scenario is to generate fabricated analogue values to a control center using a man-in-the-middle attack. Once an intruder successfully compromises the substation LAN, (s)he is able to monitor and capture all measured data which comes from power grids. If attackers send fabricated data to the control center and the data travel through the state estimation filter, control center operators will observe an operational emergency. As a result, the operators may take emergency control actions such as reducing the generation voltage or reactive power while the power system is actually in a normal condition. There is a possibility these (logical) actions based on fabricated data will drive the system into a sequence of cascading events, leading to a power outage. Mitigation actions are conducted on substation IT and power grid. For IT mitigation, intrusion detection system (IDS) which uses anomaly detection algorithm based on temporal event construction has been used in a substation network. An Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm with an objective function that minimizes load shedding in the grid is used for power system mitigation. The proposed collaboration scheme between IDS and the firewall is able to disconnect intruders in the substation network. Emergency control actions are taken to mitigate the effects of cyber intrusions as an attempt to restore a system back to a normal condition.","1944-9925","978-1-4673-2729-9","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345766","","Substations;Educational institutions;Circuit breakers;User interfaces;Computer security","cryptography;firewalls;Internet;load shedding;microprocessor chips;power grids;power system security;SCADA systems;substations;transport protocols;user interfaces;wide area networks","cyberphysical security;microprocessor based intelligent electronic devices;standardized protocol;TCP/IP;wide area networks;user interfaces;remote access;Web server;remote configuration;firewalls;key management cryptography;Stuxnet attack;intrusion attempts;anomaly detection;intruders foot prints;substation cyber intrusion;SCADA;substation gateway;open circuit breaker command;control center operators;man-in-the-middle attack;power grids;state estimation filter;IT mitigation;intrusion detection system;optimal power flow algorithm;objective function;load shedding;power system mitigation;emergency control","","2","","1","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Local execution and caching preserves user experience comparable to traditionally installed applications. To explore feasibility, Intel conducted a proof-of-concept (POC) to evaluate streaming in its call center and manufacturing environments on multi-user systems. The four-part study included performance, usability, IT operations and total cost of ownership (TCO). The proof-of-concept was successful in identifying streaming as a feasible technology with good performance and positive TCO in the tested scenarios. The biggest benefits were related to locking down the client and thus eliminating service calls related to configuration changes, software installation and viruses.

It also presents usability and unavailability problems if the SMS service is inaccessible, especially when traveling or in case of a damaged or stolen phone. Using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect and prevent fraudulent actions allows financial organizations to stay one step ahead of fraudsters, whose scale and sophistication continue to grow.

The DACS scheme performs network management efficiently through the communication control of a client. As the characteristic of DACS scheme, only the setup modification is required by a system administrator, when configuration change of the network system is done. Then, the setup modification by a customer is unnecessary, which shows a merit for both the system administrator and the customer. But, there are some security problems to be solved.

Steps include: Establishing a control point to force control of the security decision process from the existing system. Identifying an environment parameter with which the security will trade off. Studying the interrelationship between security and the environment parameter in the existing system context by identifying measurable factors which influence their relationship.

This problem is exacerbated for those operational technology (OT) networks supporting industrial control systems (ICS) since much of that equipment was originally designed to be on a network that was isolated and generally considered free of malefactors. Increasing pressure to bridge these systems with traditional information technology (IT) networks has introduced a bevy of new threats. In response, both academia and industry have responded with security solutions tailored to ICS environments. Deploying these protection systems often involves several configuration choices. While some of these choices are clear (e.g., block/enable protocol X) others are far more subjective (e.g. alert threshold == 3.43). Further complicating the situation, while often similar to IT networks, OT networks have unique challenges and characteristics that make the task of protecting them simultaneously more difficult and straight forward. Extant solutions for quantifying the relative security of intrusion detection systems fail to effectively support the operators of said systems with understanding the impact of various configuration changes. Further, they assume that the attacks are static and not subject to manipulation or alteration in the face of defenses. In this paper, we present a threat-based method for quantifying the relative impact of various security settings for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) within ICS environments. This method provides operational staff with a clear understanding of the relative impact of their settings and assumes that the attacks levied against them are dynamic. The model is described in detail, we apply the model to a synthetic data set, and discuss the inferences that can be made and what types of decisions they could be used to support.","","978-1-7281-6389-5","10.1109/ICPS48405.2020.9274691","Battelle; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274691","industrial control systems;intrusion detection systems;assessment;risk quantification","Security;Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;Software;Government;Task analysis;Risk management","computer network security;industrial control;local area networks;production engineering computing","security-relevant settings;anomaly-based intrusion detection;industrial control systems;OT networks;intrusion detection systems;Ethernet-based network;operational technology networks;configuration changes;IDS;ICS","","1","","19","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When such networks have multiple IP domains between the external gateway and internal networks, domains that are lower in the hierarchy become more secure, but at the cost of flexibility.

Given the trend toward interconnecting OT and IT networks for business reasons, and given the disclosure of highly sophisticated attacks against OT environments, OT network operators increasingly recognize the need to deploy security solutions that are widely known in IT also to OT. OT networks are running critical control processes. Configuration changes are avoided to reduce the risk of misconfiguration or unforeseeable side effects detrimental to the network's operation. Therefore, passive non-intrusive security technologies are favored. Consequently, security intelligence applied to passively collected network data is the most acceptable technology to be deployed in OT networks.

At the planning stage, the defender can utilize software diversity, which is a common phenomenon that the cyber software of different substations comes from different competing vendors. Therefore, different kinds of software may not be exposed to the same zero-day security loophole, preventing the attacker from taking charge of multiple substations at the same time. In this paper, the optimal scheme of software deployment considering long-term risk mitigation is studied. Firstly, the framework of diversity-based cyber defense against malicious attacks is formulated. Secondly, the risk index based on representative attack patterns is constructed, which is the objective to be minimized. Thirdly, considering that the deployment scheme is long-term stable while the operating mode varies with time, we construct a multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming to mitigate the average risk of operating modes. Then the optimization problem is solved by the multiobjective genetic algorithm. Lastly, results of the IEEE 39-node CPPS and and the Virtual European Grid demonstrate that the proposed method can considerably reduce the attack risk.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3086681","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2017YFB0903000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1766203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447199","Cyber-physical power system;multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA);nonlinear integer programming;risk mitigation;stochastic programming;software diversity","Substations;Cyberattack;Software;Power systems;Indexes;Security;Risk management","computer crime;cyber-physical systems;genetic algorithms;nonlinear programming;power engineering computing;power generation protection;power grids;power system security;risk management;software engineering;stochastic programming;substations","diversity-based cyber defense;malicious attacks;risk index;representative attack patterns;attack risk;software deployment;long-term risk mitigation;cyber-physical power systems;wide-area cyber attacks;software diversity;cyber software;zero-day security loophole;substations;multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming;optimization;multiobjective genetic algorithm;IEEE 39-node CPPS;virtual European grid","","1","","38","IEEE","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Biometrics is a way to measure a person’s physical characteristics to authenticate their identity. Though these uni-modal biometric systems are more secure than the previous traditional approaches. Unimodal biometric systems are unable to handle situations including noisy data and non-universalities, inter-class variations, intra-class variations, and spoof attacks. Some of the problems can be solved by implementing multi-modal biometrics. It has become necessary due to recent technological advances to apply multi-modal biometrics to everyday applications. We present a multi-modal technique in which fingerprint and facial characteristics are integrated at fully connected layers.

This paper aims at establishing an step-by-step algorithm to study impacts of error in measurements on system security indices. Two different security indices representing under voltage severity and over load severity are studied in this paper. The proposed algorithm has three major steps. In the first step, typical measurements are sampled according to the system operating state and randomly generated errors. This is done using Monte Carlo sampling approach. The second step is to extract an approximate model of the system true state which is done via state estimators. Then, security indices are calculated for both the approximated and true states in the third step. Comparison between the indices demonstrates impacts of the erroneous measurements on security assessment.","2164-7054","978-1-4799-1972-7","10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7146480","Erroneous measurement;Monte Carlo simulation;security analysis;state estimation","Decision support systems;Electrical engineering;Conferences","measurement errors;Monte Carlo methods;power system security","security assessment;Monte Carlo sampling approach;randomly generated errors;over load severity;voltage severity;power system real-time security analysis;erroneous measurements","","3","","11","IEEE","2 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, network providers are incapable of handling all types of attacks as each security device is designed for a certain purpose. If an attack breaks out, only one particular device becomes busy in terms of resource usage while others being idle. Moreover, it is hard to adjust a level of security service with respect to the importance of network flow. To address these issues, we propose a new security solution, QoSE, which provides adaptive security services based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). QoSE provides a capability to manage resource usage that the network flow is not concentrated on a specific node. We design QoSE considering a distributed NFV environment to avoid a single point of failure and a bottleneck problem. Our proposed solution has also shown a quick recovery from fault situation. In addition, we provide a novel resource optimization algorithm to operate security services efficiently.

However, terrorism actions could be considered as the largest threat to the power infrastructure in some countries. The robustness and security of a power system has to be related to the ability of the system to support contingencies due to terrorism actions. Therefore, methods and techniques should be developed with the main aim of improving power system security against terrorism. To collaborate to this effort this paper proposes an extension of a well known classification of events and operating states. A classification that includes internal and external natural and unnatural or man caused events is important for proposing new security analysis methods that consider event uncertainties.

However, the more functions it has, the more difficulties occur in operation of the functions. To cope up with this problem, an effective user interface should be developed. Furthermore, the user interface is needed to be wearable for portability and prompt action. This research starts at the question: how to teleoperate the complicated slave robot easily. The main challenge is to make a simple and intuitive user interface with a wearable shape and size. This research provides multi-modalities such as visual, auditory and haptic sense.

Although in recent years significant progress has been achieved in biometric identification technology, the progress of single technologies does not dramatically improve the overall performance or solve the system-level problems of social security. Currently in addition to improvements of single technology, the following system-level technical bottlenecks must be solved to improve the overall performance of social security: 1. Blind spots of perception exist in surveillance area of due to the non-overlap of surveillance sensors, 2. The performance of single identification technology decreases sharply in complex surveillance scenarios such as poor lighting conditions or disguise, 3. Traditional warning technologies become invalid due to the multi-stage non-stationary evolution feature of complex events. Three challenges listed above closely relate to three scientific problems in the analysis technology of big visual data on three levels: sensing data, identification technology and pattern recognition. Our study aims at (1) exploiting the complete mapping mechanism between physical space and multivariate sensing spaces to fill-in the blind spots of sensing data, (2) exploring the correlative mechanism of multi-modal objects in multivariate sensing spaces to improve the analytical performance from single identification technology, (3) studying the spatial-temporal evolution mechanism in the entire lifecycle of complex events to extend pattern recognition from local space and time. The security space is the physical space with comprehensive protective ability, which includes ubiquitous sensing, reliable identification, penetrating trend analysis and approaching danger warning at any time, at any location, for any object and for any behavior. Aiming to build the theory of security space, this study is divided into three levels: information acquisition and perceptional computation, scene analysis and evolution prediction, resource scheduling and system applications. Then it is further divided into five tasks: (1) task 1: visual object recognition and big data based identification, (2) task 2: situational awareness of groups and multi-scale revolution, (3) task 3: semantic analysis of scenes and correlative computation in multivariate spaces, (4) task 4: big scale visual retrieval and security risk analysis, (5) task 5: Warning system of the security space and its applications. Task 1 corresponds to the first level because sensing and identification of objects is the basis for analysis. Task 2 and 3 correspond to the second level since group behavior, events, scene and their evolution are crucial for the prediction and warning of security events. Task 4 and 5 correspond to the third level of this study in order to develop the high performance computing platform, to conduct system evaluation and application demonstration. Big visual data contains massive high-dimensional sensing data, implying the complicated relationship among social objects. In fact, in the world of data, the spatial-temporal relationship between the big data objects is more essential than the causal relationship, and these private and implicit relationships compose the core values of the big data social analysis. Only the analysis of individuals, groups and scenes in big visual data are based on the core element of social security analysis, that is"" social structure and social activities"", can it supports the strategic transference of urban security system from investigation afterwards to warning in advance. The overall purpose of this study is to build the big data analysis system in security space, realizing the intelligent big visual data system which supports data analysis of hundred billions of feature data, billions of image data, millions of visual sensing terminals. The expected achievements on the warning and protection system for large spaces can reach the international leading level. Based on the achievements above, the project plans to develop 10 intelligent big data analysis products of 3 categories, and the expected benefits of industrialization promotion can reach 100 billion, which promotes the upstream and downstream industry to realize economic benefits 3 billion. Also we strive to become the internationally leading industry in the field of big security data analysis.","","978-1-5090-3677-6","10.1109/CBD.2016.065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815231","big visual data;security space;social security","Security;Sensors;Visualization;Big data;Object recognition;Surveillance;Data analysis","Big Data;biometrics (access control);data analysis;data visualisation;pattern recognition;risk analysis;security of data;surveillance;ubiquitous computing","warning system;security risk analysis;big scale visual retrieval;semantic analysis;Big Data based identification;visual object recognition;system applications;resource scheduling;evolution prediction;scene analysis;perceptional computation;information acquisition;trend analysis penetration;reliable identification;ubiquitous sensing;pattern recognition;sensing data;social security;biometric identification technology;surveillance;seeing;security space;Big visual data analysis;key technology","","3","","","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the Benders' Decomposition technique has been applied by decomposing the problem into two parts: the master problem; and the subproblems. The master problem which is the unit commitment problem contains integer variables as the on-off status of the generating units, and therefore could be solved as Mixed-Integer Programming problem. The branch-and-cut method has been chosen to solve the master mixed-integer problem. There are two subproblems considered in this research: the power flow mismatch equations; and the operating limits of power systems. If the conditions in any subproblems are violated, the Benders Cuts corresponding to the violated constraints are added to the master problem and the mixed-integer unit commitment problem could be resolved. The proposed algorithm is tested on the IEEE 57-bus system with 7 thermal generating units. The 24-hour load data is made available along with the additional data for generating units. The results of typical unit commitment, security-constrained unit commitment under normal operating states and SCUC with contingency states are compared. The results show that the total generating costs of SCUC with contingency are higher than the others. However the committed units of that SCUC ensure that the system could still serve load when contingency occurs.","","978-1-4244-5607-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491412","","Power generation;Load flow;Mathematical model;Power engineering and energy;Equations;System testing;Power system simulation;Power system planning;Cost function;Power systems","integer programming;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power generation scheduling;power system security","security-constrained unit commitment;mixed-integer programming;Benders decomposition;integer variables;branch-and-cut method;power flow mismatch equation;IEEE 57-bus system;generation units","","1","","11","","24 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-modal biometric systems are commonly believed to be intrinsically more robust to spoof attacks, but recent works have shown that they can be evaded by spoofing even a single biometric trait. This result was however obtained under the worst-case scenario that the attacker is able to fabricate an exact replica of the genuine biometric trait, which was simulated by assuming that the matching score distribution of fake traits is identical to the one of genuine users. This demands for a more thorough investigation of the robustness of multi-modal biometric systems against realistic spoof attacks, namely under non-worst case scenarios. In this paper we focus on bi-modal systems made up of a face and a fingerprint matcher, whose scores are fused using the well-known sum, product, weighted sum and likelihood ratio (LLR) rules. We evaluate their robustness against realistic spoof attacks obtained by fabricating fake biometric traits. The main goal of our study is to investigate whether a realistic spoof attack against both modalities can allow the attacker to crack the multimodal system. Our results show that even in a realistic, non-worst case scenario, the false acceptance rate (FAR) can remarkably increase.","","978-1-4577-0766-7","10.1109/BIOMS.2011.6053682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6053682","","Face;Robustness;Biometrics;Three dimensional displays;Security;Face recognition;Cameras","authorisation;fingerprint identification;fraud","spoof attack;fake biometric trait;security;multimodal biometric system;matching score distribution;bimodal system;fingerprint matcher;likelihood ratio rule;false acceptance rate","","10","","21","IEEE","31 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the key enabler of a smart grid, numerous sensors such as PMU and current sensors transmit real-time dynamic data, which is usually protected by encryption algorithm from malicious attacks, over wide-area-network (WAN) to power system control centers so that monitoring and control of the whole system is possible.

First, we measure energy consumptions of various security algorithms on CrossBow and Ember sensor nodes. Second, we propose an array of novel code optimization methods to increase energy consumption efficiency of different security algorithms.

Machine learning techniques can play a pivotal role for the contextual processing of multimodal data, however, due to the low computational power of the HA devices, the data must be processed either on the edge or cloud which, in turn, poses privacy concerns for the users' sensitive data. Existing literature proposes several techniques for data encryption but their computational complexity is a major bottleneck to meet strict latency requirements for the development of future multi-modal hearing aids. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a novel real-time audio/visual data encryption scheme based on chaos-based encryption using the Tangent-Delay Ellipse Reflecting Cavity-Map System (TD-ERCS) and Non-linear Chaotic (NCA) Algorithms. The results achieved against different security analysis parameters such as Correlation Coefficient, Unified Averaged Changed Intensity (UACI), Key Sensitivity Analysis, Number of Changing Pixel Rate (NPCR), Mean-Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Entropy test, and Chi-test, indicate that the proposed scheme is more secure with increased key-space against modern brute-force attacks and lightweight as compared to existing schemes.","","978-1-6654-2141-6","10.1109/DSC54232.2022.9888823","EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/T021063/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9888823","","Performance evaluation;Correlation coefficient;Visualization;PSNR;Sensitivity analysis;Mean square error methods;Hearing aids","","","","","","10","IEEE","26 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, using a single biometric has several problems. In order to alleviate these problems, multi-modal biometric systems are proposed by combining various biometric modalities to improve the robustness of person authentication. A typical application is to combine both audio and face for multimodal person recognition, since either face or voice is among the most natural biometrics that people use to identify each other. In this paper, a novel approach called multi-feature subspace analysis (MFSA) is proposed for audio-video based biometric person recognition. In the MFSA framework, each face sequence or utterance is represented with a fix-length feature vector, and then subspace analysis method is performed on a collection of random subspaces to construct an ensemble of classifiers for robust recognition. Experiments on the XM2VTSDB corpus sufficiently validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our new approach.","2164-4357","978-1-4799-4808-6","10.1109/ICIST.2014.6920592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6920592","Audio-Video Based Person Recognition;Subspace Model","Face recognition;Face;Feature extraction;Speech;Databases;Training;Testing","face recognition;feature extraction;random processes;speaker recognition","multifeature subspace analysis method;audio-video based multimodal person recognition;biometric person recognition;security demands;law enforcement applications;commercial applications;multimodal biometric systems;natural biometrics;audio-video based biometric person recognition;MFSA framework;face sequence;utterance;fix-length feature vector;random subspaces;robust recognition;XM2VTSDB corpus","","","","17","IEEE","13 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A biometric system works by collecting important biological or behavioural traits of the prospective user. Extracted traits are stored as a feature template in the database of the biometric system. The reliability and accuracy of the biometric systems are improved by using multiple modalities, sensors or algorithms during recognition process. These systems are called as Multibiomtric systems which results into greater accuracy but with increased cost and complexity. In comparison to unibiometric system, a multi-modal system provides better recognition performance and protection from spoof attacks. Biometric systems are generally used in modern day computing to provide security during authentication in many applications but these systems themselves are vulnerable to various types of attacks. In this paper, an analysis of various security issues and template security schemes for Biometric Systems is presented. One of the challenges is to protect user's raw image data from imposters as well as to secure template data. It is found that template data security is a major design issue and needs to be addressed by designing low overhead security schemes. Template security schemes are dependent on the overall performance parameters of the system and must be computationally hard to avoid modality reconstruction.","","978-1-4673-8253-3","10.1109/RAECS.2015.7453302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7453302","Biometric systems;Feature Template;Template security;privacy protection;Multimodal biometrics;Feature fusion","Databases;Fingerprint recognition;Feature extraction;Cryptography;Sensors","data protection;feature extraction;object recognition;security of data;visual databases","performance analysis;template data security;template data protection;biometric system database;human identification;human verification;biological traits;behavioural traits;feature template;recognition process;multibiomtric systems;unibiometric system;multimodal system;spoof attacks;security issues;template security schemes;user raw image data protection","","6","","21","IEEE","19 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The higher level of uncertainty that stems from this variability makes it more difficult to determine whether a given operating condition will be secure or insecure. Data-driven techniques provide a promising way to identify security rules that can be embedded in economic dispatch model to keep power system operating states secure. This paper proposes using a sparse weighted oblique decision tree to learn accurate, understandable, and embeddable security rules that are linear and can be extracted as sparse matrices using a recursive algorithm. These matrix rules can then be easily embedded as security constraints in power system economic dispatch calculations using the Big-M method. Tests on several large datasets with high renewable energy penetration demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the sparse weighted oblique decision tree outperforms the state-of-art weighted oblique decision tree while keeping the security rules simple. When embedded in the economic dispatch, these rules significantly increase the percentage of secure states and reduce the average solution time.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2020.3019383","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2017YFB0902200); Science and Technology Foundation of State Grid Corporation of China(grant numbers:5228001700CW); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51620105007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177087","Data-driven;High renewable penetration;Oblique decision tree;Power system security;Sparsity;rules extraction;security-constrained economic dispatch;security-constrained optimal power flow","Security;Decision trees;Power system stability;Economics;Sparse matrices;Optimization;Renewable energy sources","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power system security;sparse matrices","sparse weighted oblique decision tree;accurate security rules;understandable, security rules;embeddable security rules;sparse matrices;matrix rules;security constraints;power system economic dispatch calculations;high renewable energy penetration;state-of-art weighted oblique decision tree;secure states;sparse oblique decision tree;power system security rules extraction;variable generation;substantial effect;operational reliability;power systems;given operating condition;data-driven techniques;economic dispatch model;power system operating states","","14","","35","IEEE","25 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore simulate the cascading process of power system is more meaningful than a single device contingency analysis. Against such backgrounds, this paper proposes a method for cascading failure simulation with static security analysis method, which considers the load variation during the fault. The method is divided into two steps: firstly, a self-adapting step is figured out with the climbing rate of the daily load curve, and secondly, the power flow at the self-adapting step, which is used to judge if another fault or even the cascading event has happened is calculated. In this way, the process of cascading failure can be simulated and monitored, which is beneficial for the operators to obtain the operating state of the power system in time and adopt appropriate measures to prevent the system from deteriorating into a large-scale blackout accidents. Finally, the standard IEEE 30-bus testing system is adopted to verify the correctness of the method.","2157-4847","978-1-4244-2486-3","10.1109/APPEEC.2009.4918053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4918053","","Power system faults;Power system protection;Analytical models;Failure analysis;Power system simulation;Power system security;Power system analysis computing;Load management;Load flow;Condition monitoring","load flow;load regulation;power system faults;power system reliability;power system security;power system simulation","cascading failure simulation;static security analysis;power system fault;load variation;large-scale blackout accidents;IEEE 30-bus testing system","","3","","16","IEEE","12 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many network planning and operation procedures set forth by Independent System Operators and followed by many utilities consider the computation of the VSSM for a predefined load increase direction. Usually, this direction corresponds to increasing all loads with constant power factor and the MW generated at generation buses by using one loading factor only. However, situations may occur where small variations in this direction, as for example, an unexpected load increase at any bus or set of buses, may result in smaller VSSM, thus leading the system to an insecure operating state. The goal of this paper is to propose a combination of a fast method to estimate the VSSM with an efficient method to calculate the appropriate direction of load increase for which the margin is minimum. This information, along with the usual VSSM, can provide system operators with relevant information regarding the system's security. More complete information allow operators to take decisions like preventive control actions to move the system to a securer operating point. The procedure is divided into two main stages. The first one consists of estimating the maximum loading point (MLP) and consequently the VSSM, by using nonlinear programming techniques. The second stage consists of computing new directions of load increase. These new directions are based on eigenvector handling. Also, the use of a special load flow method with step size optimization results into a more efficient computation process. Simulation results for IEEE standard and realistic power systems are shown to evaluate the method.","","1-4244-0110-0","10.1109/ICPST.2006.321785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4116416","Power system security;voltage stability;maximum loading point (MLP);nonlinear programming;eigenanalysis","Power system stability;Power system security;Voltage;Power system planning;Power generation;Power system simulation;Computer networks;Reactive power;Information security;Control systems","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;IEEE standards;load flow;nonlinear programming;power system security;power system stability","voltage stability security margins;electrical power systems;maximum loading point;nonlinear programming techniques;eigenvector handling;load flow method;step size optimization;IEEE standard","","2","","15","IEEE","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, new strategies need to be devised for cost-effective security provision. In this paper, we motivate the integration of a context-aware security controller into LTE/EPS networks to minimize the overall security cost. This controller activates security mechanisms according to the contextual information such as the application type and the device capabilities. By means of detailed quantitative analysis, we evaluate the processing cost associated to each security service.

This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for dynamic small-signal stability assessment of power grids by estimating the region of attraction (ROA) for operating states in real time. By analyzing the latest sampling data of power grids in a fixed time window, an up-to-date training set is constructed with the aid of converse Lyapunov function, which enables us to develop an online learning approach based on Gaussian Process (GP) to assess the stability level of power grids. As a result, an iteration algorithm is designed to update the assessment parameters by learning the input-output pairs in the training set. Theoretical analysis is conducted to ensure the existence of converse Lyapunov function for differential-algebraic system that serves to describe power system dynamics, as well as to estimate the region of attraction for operating states with a given confidence level. In particular, a practical method is proposed to leverage time series of phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements including voltage/current magnitude, phase and frequency (i.e., PMU data) of real power grids for validating the online GP approach. Moreover, validations are taken to substantiate the proposed approach by using PMU data of real smart-grid infrastructure and IEEE test cases. The proposed assessment approach contributes to situational awareness of human operators in the control station, thereby taking proactive remedial actions prior to emergencies. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of online assessment of power systems security but it also applies to other industrial control systems that have stable state trajectories. Existing approaches to security assessment of power systems generally focus on the adoption of various machine-learning algorithms by treating power grid as a “black box,” which ignores the intrinsic characteristics of power systems and thus restricts the inference performance. This paper proposes a new approach using limited sampling data and system dynamics to construct a domain of stability for power grids, which can reflect the evolution of security zones and provide more accurate predictions. In this work, we mathematically characterize the domain of stability for a practical power grid by analyzing and learning its state trajectories. Then we show how the proposed approach can be efficiently implemented online, which can timely alert human operators to abnormalities. Preliminary validations suggest that this approach is feasible and effective. In future research, we will incorporate it into an energy management system and test it in other industrial processes.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3173368","Nanyang Technological University (NTU)(grant numbers:SUG 001500-00001); National Research Foundation and Energy Market Authority (EMA), Singapore(grant numbers:NRF-EMA EMA-EP004-EKJGC-0003,MOE ARF Tier 1 2019-T1-001-119); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773283","Online Gaussian process;region of attraction;power systems stability;security assessment","Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Power grids;Security;Lyapunov methods;Stability criteria;Mathematical models","energy management systems;Gaussian processes;industrial control;learning (artificial intelligence);Lyapunov methods;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power grids;power system measurement;power system security;power system stability;smart power grids;time series","dynamic security assessment;dynamic small-signal stability assessment;electrical power grids;online small-signal stability assessment;power system dynamics;power systems security;practical power grid","","","","34","IEEE","12 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, transmission reliability and security is also an equally high priority for ATC-especially in light of the tragic events on September 11, 2001. ATC believes that the information needs of an open market place need to be balanced against the need for a safe, secure national electric system.

These role-permissions assignment rules, as well as the types of system users and system functionalities, evolve over time. In this paper, we describe a methodology for analyzing and understanding the RBAC-configuration evolution, its relation to the overall evolutionary lifecycle of industrial systems, and its impact on security vulnerabilities from which the system may suffer. Our methodology considers two different sources of information regarding the RBAC-configuration evolution: 1) the role-permissions matrices of subsequent system versions; and 2) the corresponding concept lattices, implied by these matrices. By examining the evolution of these two system properties, developers can easily notice which versions involve more and more complex RBAC-configuration changes that may indicate higher security risks. We demonstrate our methodology using a study of four popular real-world systems: 1) MediaWiki; 2) Moodle; 3) Joomla; and 4) WordPress.

Also, traditional multi-modal biometric based data authentication schemes are independent of dynamic variation in integrity verification. In order to overcome these problems, a new multi-user based multi-modal authentication framework is designed and implemented on large image data types. In this framework, different biometric features such as IRIS, facial and fingerprint features are used to find the unique integrity of user for data authentication and security process.

Therefore, the use of reasonable spare inventory strategy, as well as maintenance and support decisions to systems is essential to improve system availability, security and system cost reducing. Maintenance strategy can be formulated based on the situation in which the products are monitored. For a single-component system, current research around its multi-state transferring have been quite mature, in which the conversion rate defined in a different state in Markov process can be clearly showed by conversion relationship between different state. However, the state transition process involved mostly considers the processes of repairing only, and rarely considers the impact to system availability by the transition of failure rate caused by changes in components, spare replacement strategies and spare supply. To solve this problem, this paper considered a single-component system with two derating states, and discussed its steady-state availability through variable spare replacement probability and different spare fill rate levels. With model of the system with two derating states established, generalized Markov method was used to solve the relationships between replacement timing and system availability with the level of spare fill rate considered. Finally, through the analysis of results, the preliminary conclusions were obtained. The results could clearly reveal the impacts of spare replacement strategy and spare fill rate in single-component system.","2166-5656","978-1-4799-7958-5","10.1109/PHM.2014.6988248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6988248","single-component;multi-states;replacment stategy;degradation system;system availability","Availability;Maintenance engineering;Steady-state;Markov processes;Equations;Mathematical model;Reliability engineering","cost reduction;inventory management;maintenance engineering;Markov processes","optimal replacement strategy;degradation system component;system availability;support process;equipment system;spare inventory strategy;turnaround time;product maintenance strategy;system support time;support decision;security;system cost reduction;single-component system;multistate transferring;Markov process;conversion relationship;state transition process;failure rate;spare replacement strategy;spare supply;steady-state availability;spare replacement probability;spare fill rate level;derating states;generalized Markov method;replacement timing","","","","8","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An effective way to face power system contingencies that can lead to instability is load shedding.

Probe data from mobile phones provides an important data source for collecting system performance data that can be used as feedback to improve the management of the various transportation and queuing systems used by airport travelers. This paper reports on a study using Bluetooth sensors to quantitatively evaluate the operations of airport security checkpoints. Bluetooth sensors were deployed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport from 30 August to 13 September, 2010 and collected over 100,000 travel time records between data collection stations located along access roads, parking garages, non-sterile areas of terminals, and sterile areas of terminals. In addition, hourly checkpoint passenger volumes were collected. The large volume of this data necessitated the development of statistical characterization procedures and graphics that characterize both the travel time records and checkpoint information. These checkpoint operations reports provide dashboard level reports useful for management to rapidly assess operations, and identify opportunities for improved allocation of staffing. The paper concludes by providing examples of how the checkpoint operations report concept can be extended to characterize the movement of traffic through the airport, the entire passenger arrival experience, and numerically characterize user delay in person-hours. A final overview procedure using pareto sorting to identify correctable periods where airports have opportunity to improve their utilization is shown.","2153-0017","978-1-4799-2914-6","10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6728411","","Airports;Security;Delays;Bars","airports;Bluetooth;data analysis;pedestrians;security","multimodal airport land side probe data;Bluetooth enabled mobile devices;data analysis;data collection;Bluetooth sensors;airport security checkpoint operations;George Bush Intercontinental Airport;hourly checkpoint passenger volumes;dashboard level reports;travel time records;checkpoint information","","3","","12","IEEE","30 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These substations are remotely operated by two Operating Centers - Transmission Operating Center (COT Centro de Operacao da Transmissao), Bom Jardim SP, and Back-end Operating Center (COR - Centro de Operacao Retaguarda), Cabreiiva SP. Through the years, CTEEP has been deploying its high reliability and throughput WAN/LAN to connect all of its key facilities. Based on such corporate network infrastructure, it was possible to provide remote operations with a visual, real time monitoring system. Its structure comprises cameras installed in substation strategic spots, local digital image recorder and devices to convert and regulate video streams and control cameras, and Ethernet network interfaces. The system allows visual checking of operating handling, physical status of substation yard, and perimeter integrity thus addressing many corporative areas' needs. Since there is a high reliability, high throughput corporative network infrastructure available to connect main facilities, it enable us to provide remote substation operations with support of a visual, real time monitoring system, which comprises camera movement control, tamper-proof recording, image transmission and viewing, both locally and remotely. SIM - Sistema Integrado de Monitoramento (Integrated Monitoring System) is a joint project among CTEEP's Enterprise Security, Information Technology, and Maintenance and Operations organizations. It aims to deploy a visual monitoring system for electrical substations providing camera movement control, tamper-proof recording, image transmission and viewing, both locally and remotely using existent corporative network (""browser-based""). It allows electrical system operations and enterprise security organizations to monitor substations and other CTEEP facilities through images transmitted via data channels (corporative network), which are enabled by heterogeneous technologies and throughput, from frame relay (64Kbs to 512Kbps) to fiber optic/digital radio links (2Mbps). By promoting integration of video, audio, and text information, and by associating it to company existing databases, SIM also meets CTEEP's strategic goals related to information system integration (technological convergence). In addition to align strategic information integration goals, SIM deployment will provide CTEEP Electrical Transmission System operators with environmental viewing of facilities in a real-time, strategic way, enabling an improvement of operating processes. SIM usage means lower costs related to staff displacement to remotely assisted substations, either for equipment handling checking, equipment current status checking or substation areas physical integrity checking. All of these intended to optimize access to substations risk areas. Also, note that such solution means lower operating and maintenance costs for entire company due to its standardization.","","978-1-4577-0488-8","10.1109/TDC-LA.2010.5762915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5762915","Information Integration;Visual;Real Time Monitoring;Substation Remote Operation;Enterprise Security;Operating Security","Substations;Cameras;Monitoring;Visualization;Security;Real time systems;Streaming media","computerised monitoring;local area networks;power engineering computing;substation automation;wide area networks","real-time monitoring system;remote operation;electrical substations;WAN-LAN;local digital image recorder;video streams;control cameras;Ethernet network interfaces;corporative network infrastructure;camera movement control;tamper-proof recording;image transmission;frame relay;fiber optic links;digital radio links;equipment handling checking;equipment current status checking;substation areas physical integrity checking;operating security;CTEEP;transmission operating center;back-end operating center;remote substation operations;integrated monitoring system;visual monitoring system","","4","","6","IEEE","5 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional protection systems are non-adaptive and have been usually applied with bias towards dependability, one of the two considerations on designing electric grid protection systems (the other one is security). The art and science of protection and control of tomorrow drives the power system professionals to design and implement schemes that are adaptive and aim towards security. It is important to minimize system exposures when the power system is in a stressed state or in early stages of a sequence of events to halt or mitigate disturbance propagation. One of the leading contributions to the future of grid protection would be to avoid incorrect tripping of unaffected equipment therefore maintaining the power system integrity. In addition, with the ever-increasing load demand and the advent of the deregulated power market recently, power systems are pushed more often to operate close to design limits and with more uncertainty of the system operating mode. The proposed protection systems offer adaptive concepts by adjusting the need for more dependability or security as applicable, through the application of fuzzy logic and based on a set of real-time factors, such as system state index, nodal price, and equipment outage impact index. Results from our work can be used as a roadmap for further enhancement leading to the introduction of algorithms in commercial products.","2160-8563","978-1-4244-1903-6","10.1109/TDC.2008.4517163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4517163","Dependability;security;fuzzy logic;protection systems;adaptive","Power system protection;Power system security;Power systems;Art;Control systems;Power system control;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Power markets;Uncertainty","fuzzy logic;power markets;power system protection;power system security","electric power system protection;power system security;load demand;power market deregulation;fuzzy logic","","1","","17","IEEE","12 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the growing scale of cyber systems, this task must be highly automated. Unfortunately, prior work on configuration errors has largely ignored the security impact of configurations of connected components. To address this gap, we present SCIBORG, a framework that improves the security posture of distributed systems by examining the impact of configuration changes across interdependent components using a graph-based model of the system and its vulnerabilities. It formulates a Constraint Satisfaction Problem from the graph-based model and uses an SMT solver to find optimal configuration parameter values that minimize the impact of attacks while preserving system functionality. SCIBORG also provides supporting evidence for the proposed configuration changes.

Hence, intelligent robots have diverse applications in domains such as security, automation, industry and agriculture. Such robots when used for surveillance or spying operations by military or police forces are called spybots. This paper aims to highlight the need and importance of developing systems that have the ability to remotely control their functions, response and operation, using multiple-controls and commands given by multiple-modalities. As an example, to give a live physical demonstration of the proposed concepts, a prototype smart spybot is developed. The prototype spybot can be controlled using multi-modalities such as text, touch, speech and gestures. It can be remotely operated using an application running on an Android based smart-phone, or a website, or an interactive program running on a laptop. Each can be connected by wires or wirelessly. The prototype spybot also has decision making capability and obstacle-avoidance feature. It is GPS enabled, and can be used as a tracker also. This intelligent spybot can directly fetch the live-video feeds and the spied data to a website, along with GPS coordinates. Since the prototype spybot is speech and gesture-enabled, it can also be used effectively by the people having restricted physical abilities. The initial performance results and trials are encouraging.

In this paper, we propose a pedestrian classification method based on the multiple kernel learning framework; standard pixel features (such as spatial derivatives) from both imaging modalities are employed to learn several feature-related basic kernels and a compound kernel is found as an optimized linear combination of basic kernels.

For identification, the proposed system uses soft-biometrics such as color and height information based on smart card. It can obtain reliable feature information using smart card. In this paper, representative colors are extracted by applying octree-based color quantization technique to the clothing region and height is extracted from the geometrical information of the images.

However, there are problems using them to assess the security of dynamic networks. First, the existing graphical security models are unable to capture dynamic changes occurring in the networks over time. Second, the existing security metrics are not designed for dynamic networks such that their effectiveness to the dynamic changes in the network is still unknown. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis via simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of security metrics using a Temporal Hierarchical Attack Representation Model. Further, we investigate the varying effects of security metrics when changes are observed in the dynamic networks.

In distributed real-time embedded applications, e.g., electric grid management and command and control applications, it is required to not only meet real-time constraints but also support the data confidentiality,integrity, and authenticity. Unfortunately, in general, cryptographic functions are computationally expensive, possibly causing deadline misses in real-time embedded systems with limited resources. As a basis for cost-effective security support in real-time embedded systems, we define a quantitative notion of Strength of Defense (SoD). Based on the SoD concept, we propose a novel adaptive security policy in which the SoD can be degraded by decreasing the cryptographic key length for certain tasks, if necessary, to improve the success ratio under overload conditions. Our approach is lightweight. The time complexity of our approach is linear and its amortized version has the constant overhead per SoD adaptation period. Moreover, our approach supports desirable security features requiring an attacker to do extra work to find the cryptographic key. In the performance evaluation, we show that our approach can considerably improve the success ratio due to controlled SoD degradation under overload.","2325-1301","0-7695-2676-4","10.1109/RTCSA.2006.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1691312","","Real time systems;Embedded system;Cryptography;Embedded computing;Degradation;Power system security;Computer science;Application software;Control systems;Intelligent networks","computational complexity;cryptography;data integrity;embedded systems;message authentication;scheduling","distributed real-time embedded system;data confidentiality;data integrity;data authenticity;cryptographic key;cost-effective adaptive security policy;strength of defense concept;time complexity","","5","1","22","IEEE","11 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the context of self-adaptive systems, adaptive security concerns with adjusting protection mechanisms at runtime while changes occur in the operating environment. One of the challenges with self-adaptation paradigm is that the reasoning engine must leverage existing requirements and constraints and at the same time deal with different types of imperfections due to absence of knowledge or data. The problem arises when the existing runtime requirements models offer no explicit support for imperfections. By imperfections, we mean the values of some attributes of interest are not available at certain points. To address this problem, we propose uncertain reasoning based on imperfect requirements using non-monotonic logic.

This has prompted most governments and business organizations to change the way they do business and manage the user's identity information. However Internet users are vulnerable to identity fraud, which is on the increase and costing the global economy excessive amounts. With the advent of wireless technologies, peer-to-peer communication, GSM networks, it is becoming more challenging to build systems to authenticate users more efficiently. Traditional methods of authenticating a user with passwords and PIN numbers only are slowly proving ineffective since these credentials are easy to guess and steal. This paper proposes a distributed multimodal authentication system as a solution for managing digital identity information on most wireless networks. The proposed system uses artificial intelligence methods and biometrics to improve the security and privacy of users and service providers in a transparent, reliable and efficient way.

Unfortunately, as we show, existing counterexample-guided algorithms can perform poorly if the system model allows configuration changes during execution. Yet disallowing such changes can hide significant problems, such as privilege escalation.

Scientist and researchers have constantly pursued the technology for automated confirmation of the identity of subjects based on measurements of physiological or behavioral traits of humans. But even the best single biometric system suffers from spoof attacks, intra-class variability, noise, susceptibility etc. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid multibiometric system which integrates multi-algorithm and multi-modal approaches of multibiometric system and use bilevel fusion to combine biometric information. We use face, ear and signature biometric traits which are first classified by three classification techniques-multilayer perceptron, Fisher-image and Bayesian network. The outcomes of these classifiers for face are fused by rank fusion method. Outcomes for ear and signature are also fused similarly. The second level fusion occurs when we combine the results of these three rank fusion methods' outcomes for face, ear and signature with decision fusion method. We use Borda count and Borda fuse approaches for rank fusion and majority voting, weighted majority voting and behavioral knowledge space approaches for decision fusion. The final results indicate that this hybrid multi biometric system outperforms the single biometric systems build on the same data using the same classification algorithms. This system can be effectively used in law enforcement or homeland security department or for commercial purposes.","","978-1-4244-2773-4","10.1109/CIB.2009.4925691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925691","","Security;Biometrics;Ear;Voting;Authentication;Access control;Electrical equipment industry;Industrial control;Humans;Bayesian methods","authorisation;belief networks;multilayer perceptrons","hybrid multibiometric system;access control;automated identity confirmation;biometric user authentication techniques;spoof attacks;intra-class variability;multi-modal approaches;biometric information;bilevel fusion;multilayer perceptron;Fisherimage;Bayesian network;rank fusion method;decision fusion method;Borda count;Borda fuse approaches;majority voting;behavioral knowledge space approaches","","3","","36","IEEE","15 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Throughout your career, you will likely have to oversee and participate in incident response activities, which will include conducting investigations, handling material that may be used as evidence in criminal prosecution and/or civil suits, and performing forensic analysis. The Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) should also be familiar with common tools for mitigating, detecting, and responding to threats and attacks; this includes knowledge of the importance and use of event logging as a means to enhance security efforts. Another facet the security practitioner may have to manage could be how the organization deals with emergencies, including disaster recovery. There is a common thread running through all aspects of this topic: supporting business functions by incorporating security policy and practices with normal daily activities.

But the recognition of face can be affected by illumination variation, facial expression and other issues. Therefore, the authentication using only face image might be difficult for the system. To overcome this challenge, biometric authentications have to rely on more than one method. In this paper, we consider audio-video person authentication based on two sources of information. Single modality evidence has limitations in both security and robustness. Therefore, here, audio recognition is added with visual recognition. Facial features, as well as speech is extracted separately from audio-visual data and integrate both the modality for secure user authentication. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is used as the speech feature. Viola-Jones and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm are used for visual feature extraction. After the extraction of audio and visual features, the feature selection method is employed. The two-phase algorithm consisting of statistical analysis, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) is proposed to select significant features from audio-visual data. The Audio and Video processing is done in two separate phases using machine learning algorithms. The results of both the modalities are then combined at the decision level based on majority voting. It has been observed that multiple modalities of both audio-visual information give immensely good results compared to a standalone single modality.","2159-3450","978-1-7281-1895-6","10.1109/TENCON.2019.8929592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8929592","Multi-modal authentication;MFCC;Viola-Jones;SIFT;ANOVA;IFS;SVM","Authentication;Feature extraction;Face;Face recognition;Speech recognition;Visualization;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","audio-visual systems;biometrics (access control);face recognition;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","standalone single modality;audio-visual information;incremental feature selection;feature selection method;visual features;audio features;visual feature extraction;scale-invariant feature transform algorithm;speech feature;secure user authentication;facial features;visual recognition;audio recognition;single modality evidence;audio-video person authentication;biometric authentications;face image;biometric method;face recognition;secured access;audio-visual data;multimodal authentication system","","","","21","IEEE","12 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ICS underpin sensitive and critical national infrastructures such as water treatment and energy production and transportation. The consequences of a successful attack against them can lead to shutting the infrastructure down which has major impacts such as production stoppages or safety implications for people, the environment, and assets. At the same time, running a process while the infrastructure is under attack or compromised also has safety im-plications, potentially catastrophic. This work-in-progress focuses on an adaptive approach, able to alter the defensive posture while providing assurances about operational capacity (or downgrading it) and safety. Our approach involves transforming policies from simply a means to enforce security requirements defined a priori, to adaptive objects that are capable to evolve in response to unfolding attacks.

The security assessment of power system is being considered as an important problem in planning, operation and control. Security assessment entails that the system should remain in secure operating state under abnormal conditions. In a power system the Security assessment is carried out by using the voltage performance index (VPI) following a contingency. Contingencies are termed as the uncertain events, occurred due to line outage in the system. VPI can be used for identifying the critical contingency from the perspective of bus voltage violation limits. Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices are having a great impact on the performance of the transmission network. FACTS devices are used for controlling real and reactive power flows and regulating the bus voltages in power systems. Also, FACTS devices raises power transfer capability reduces system losses and improves system stability, because of their fast and flexible control characteristics. Owing to their huge capital cost, it is essential to place these devices optimally in a power system. In this paper, Differential Evolution (DE), a population based stochastic meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is applied for optimal placement of static var compensator (SVC) aimed to the voltage security enhancement of a power system. The SVC placement is considered to be a planning problem and is formulated as a multi-criteria problem comprising of minimization of real power loss, voltage security and investment cost of SVC under single line outage contingencies. Effectiveness of the DE algorithm based approach has been demonstrated on IEEE 30-bus test system.","","978-1-4799-4040-0","10.1109/ICRAIE.2014.6909310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909310","Power system Security;FACTS;SVC;Single line Outage Contingency;Real Power Loss;VPI;Cost of SVC;DE Algorithm","Static VAr compensators;Sociology;Statistics;Reactive power;Indexes","electricity supply industry;flexible AC transmission systems;load flow control;losses;optimisation;performance index;power system security;power system stability;power transmission control;power transmission planning;static VAr compensators;stochastic programming;voltage control","optimal placement;optimal sizing;SVC;voltage security improvement;differential evolution algorithm;restructuring power systems;electric utilities;power system security assessment;power system planning;power system operation;power system control;secure operating state;abnormal conditions;voltage performance index;VPI;line outage;critical contingency identification;bus voltage violation limits;flexible alternating current transmission systems devices;FACTS devices;transmission network;real power flow control;reactive power flow control;bus voltage regulation;power transfer capability;system loss reduction;system stability improvement;capital cost;DE;population based stochastic meta-heuristic optimization algorithm;static var compensator;multicriteria problem;IEEE 30-bus test system;loss minimization","","13","","28","IEEE","25 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The vehicle's intelligent terminal can be used to launch for further attacks on the on-board operating system to penetrate into the internal network of connected vehicle, and consequently threaten the safety of the vehicle. Thus, it is of paramount importance that we protect the security of the intelligent terminal. We propose two intelligent terminal based privacy-preserving multi-modal implicit authentication protocols to protect the security of the intelligent terminal in IOV. The proposed protocols use the password and the vehicle owner's behavior features as the authentication factors to protect the security of the intelligent terminal. Since the vehicle owner's behavior features are sensitive and the privacy information of the user must be protected, we also consider the privacy protection of the behavior features. Our protocols do not reveal any information about the vehicle owner's behavior features to the authentication server and the adversary except the ciphertext size of the feature vector. We analyze the security of our proposed protocol and compare them with other related protocols in terms of computation and communications costs. Our results demonstrate that our proposed protocols yield better security and efficiency.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.2998775","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772548,61672413,61872449,61972294,61932016); Foundation of Science and Technology on Information Assurance Laboratory(grant numbers:KJ-17-001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9134389","Authentication;connected vehicles;intelligent terminal;Internet of Vehicles;privacy;protocol","Authentication;Protocols;Privacy;Internet;Connected vehicles;Password","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;Internet of Things","intelligent terminal;Internet of connected vehicles;intelligent transportation systems;integrated service system;IOV security;IOV architecture;intelligent terminal security;connected vehicle;vehicle owner;privacy-preserving;multimodal implicit authentication protocol;automatic driving;information services;vehicle intelligent terminal;on-board operating system;password protocols;vehicle owner behavior;authentication server;ciphertext size;feature vector","","25","","36","IEEE","7 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The probability of success of most of these attacks mainly depends on their timeliness, as the degree of system vulnerabilities varies from time to time by changing its operating state. In this paper, we propose a new denial of service (DoS) attack strategy where the attackers leverage learning capabilities of convolutional neural networks in the encrypted domain to forecast the optimal time of launching a DoS attack. In our simulations Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is used to secure communication channels between phasor measurement units, phasor data concentrators, and the regional/national control center. It is illustrated that, despite providing confidential communication channels by IPsec-based security gateways, an attacker still can estimate the future operating state of the power system in advance. This gives an opportunity to the attackers for initiating an effective DoS attack. The proposed method is validated by the simulation results, which show a significant increase in the success rate of DoS attacks.","","978-1-6654-8032-1","10.1109/ISGT-Europe54678.2022.9960467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9960467","cyber-physical systems;encrypted data classification;denial of service attack;power system blackout;wide area monitoring system","Protocols;Power system protection;Communication channels;Power system stability;Feature extraction;Phasor measurement units;Data models","computer network security;convolutional neural nets;cyber-physical systems;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Internet;IP networks;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system security;protocols;telecommunication computing","cascading failure;confidential communication channels;convolutional neural networks;deep learning-based strategy;denial of service attack;effective DoS attack;Internet protocol security;IPsec-based security gateways;leverage learning capabilities;malicious attacks;national control center;phasor data concentrators;phasor measurement units;PMU-based cyber-physical power systems;regional control center;service attack strategy;system vulnerabilities;widespread blackout","","","","12","IEEE","28 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multimodal authentication systems represent an emerging trend for cloud information security. Multi-modal Biometric Frameworks (MBF) utilize more than one biometric identifier to recognize a person. MBF are expected to be more reliable due to the presence of multiple independent pieces of biometric traits. The aim of these multibiometric systems is to achieve a high reliability to determine or verify person's identity. The motivation for using fuzzy logic is that it offers methods best suited to model the information that is inherently uncertain and ambiguous. This paper implements score level fusion based on fuzzy logic for developing Fuzzy Rule Based (FRB) MBF. The matching module integrates fuzzy logic methods for matching score fusion. This approach is tested on the fingerprint and face score database of 102 people obtained from NIST BSSR1 database.

This leads to open and outsourcing all or part of their information system (IS) to create collaborative processes by composing business services picked in each partner IS and to take advantage of Cloud computing. Business services outsourcing and their dynamic collaboration context can bring lost of control on IS and new security risks can occur. This leads to inconsistent protection allowing competitors to access to unauthorized information. To address this issue, systematic security service invocations may be added, without paying attention to the business context leading to costly over protection. To address this issue, an adaptive security service model deployment is required to provide a business service consistent protection by taking into account the collaboration context (business service data criticity, partners involved in the collaboration, etc.), and the cloud deployment and execution environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security model based on MDS@run.time, the marriage of Model Driven Security (MDS) and Models@run.time approaches, allowing to select at runtime the appropriate security components to apply. The MDS approach is used to generate security policies, which are interpreted at runtime and load appropriate security mechanisms depending on the context (which takes advantage of the Models@run.time approach) ensuring business process end to end protection. A proof of concept prototype is built on top of the OW2 FraSCAti middleware, validating our proposition efficiency. Our experiments and simulations show that MDS@run.time improves the system efficiency when the over-protection risk rate increases.","","978-1-4799-8356-8","10.1109/SOSE.2015.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133513","","Context;Business;Authentication;Context modeling;Middleware;Collaboration","cloud computing;groupware;information systems;middleware;outsourcing;risk management;security of data;software performance evaluation","service protection optimization;model driven security@run.time;MDS@run.time;collaborative business;information system;business services outsourcing;dynamic collaboration context;cloud computing;security risks;adaptive security service model deployment;business service consistent protection;business service data criticity;cloud deployment;execution environment;Models@run.time;security policy generation;OW2 FraSCAti middleware;system efficiency improvement;over-protection risk rate","","2","","29","IEEE","25 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Approaches based on manually written rules are often fragile and require constant maintenance in this era of continuous integration. In this paper, we propose a novel “discovery by example” approach to autonomously search for and identify system changes. Our approach learns characteristic features of system changes automatically, without requiring any explicit rule definitions or specific knowledge of the underlying software or systems. In this approach, given a system change, our method searches a repository that contains previous stored system changes and returns those that are similar to it. We further explore the use of various forms of “fingerprints” to represent system changes efficiently and faithfully in a compact manner. We propose and evaluate two types of fingerprints: the “basename fingerprint” and the “1-D histogram fingerprint”. We show that both fingerprints exhibit different efficiency and accuracy trade-offs, and they can be effectively employed in different use cases.

Since most of the produced energy from distributed renewable sources arises as electricity, electrification of energy consumers and producers, called prosumers, expands. In this context, multimodal distribution grids make use of the storage capabilities of other energy sectors like heat, and abolish the supply-dependency and uncertainty of the feed-in of decentralized generators. This provides flexibility in the energy system, which increases security of supply and at the same time ensures economical energy provision. The subject of this paper is to exploit the flexibility of such a multi-modal energy system for operation in an optimal way. The cellular approach serves here as the energy system architecture. Aim is to provide flexibility with a cell by optimally distributing a flexibility request to subordinate prosumers changing their active and reactive power. The load change is hereby to be optimally dispatched to the different components of the prosumers under consideration of technical restrictions and dynamic behavior of components, the grids and economical aspects. For dynamic modelling and simulation the open-source modelling language Modelica is used. Using a lowvoltage benchmark model expanded by multi-modal technologies, the proposed methodology shows that the cells are capable of providing flexibility to the overlying grid with high accuracy at low costs.","","978-3-8007-6108-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172983","","","","","","","","","","4 Jul 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Solutions for enabling information security in BANs require extensive use of cryptographic primitives that involve considerable performance overhead. Consequently, information security is typically not available in wearable technologies. We need adaptive security solutions that increase the level of security in the event of threats but otherwise impose minimal security overhead in order for them to viable for BANs. The first step in building adaptive security for BANs is to detect the threats. In this paper we propose a solution for detecting adversaries attacking the communication channel of a BAN called a wearable honeypot system.

Wireless sensor networks play significant role in building such systems as they can effectively act as the human-physical interface with the digital world through sensing, communication, computing and control or actuation. However, the inherent characteristics of wireless sensor networks, typified by resource constraints, high degree of uncertainty, heterogeneity and distributed control pose significant challenges. After introducing the basic challenges, opportunities and applications, this talk will present a novel framework for multi-modal context recognition from sensor streaming data, context-aware data fusion, and situation-aware decision making with a trade-off between information accuracy (hence inference quality) and energy consumption. The underlying approach is based on dynamic Bayesian model, information theoretic reasoning, and game theory.

The proposed microchip is capable of emulating behaviors of large power system networks under various conditions with faster than real-time computation time that is independent of the size of the power system network. The proposed model focuses on static security analysis, where the main objective is to access the existing operating state of the system. If the state is found to be secure, contingency analysis is performed to evaluate system vulnerability and time necessary to obtain such results. This time is compared to traditional computational techniques to evaluate static security of a power system.

In this article, we introduce a graph-based framework for performing cyber-security analysis in power system state estimation.

It actively emits almost inaudible acoustic signals from the earpiece speaker to ""illuminate"" the user's face and extracts features from the echoes using a customized convolutional neural network, which are fused with sophisticated visual features extracted from state-of-the-art face recognition models, for secure face authentication. Because the echo features depend on 3D facial geometries and material, our multi-modal design is not easily spoofed by images or videos like image based face recognition systems. It does not require any special sensors thus eliminating the extra costs in solutions like FaceID.

An assured and trusted baseline is key to detecting atypical or malicious traffic. A testbed has been developed that models the regular ATM-grade IP-network behavior. The sample configuration uses open source stacks ElastiFlow, and SELKS to provide network flow data collection and visualization and demonstrate resilience against hacking attempts via unauthorized communication and protocols between nodes, unauthorized configuration changes via distribution of parameters to network nodes, as well as detection of malicious communication attempts from unauthorized devices on the network. A Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture is chosen as it features a programmable, efficient network configuration improving network performance and monitoring. The OpenFlow protocol is used to provide the control plane in the testbed. Data flows will be modeled as synchronous as well as asynchronous. Vulnerabilities are then identified, attack scenarios defined and applied to the testbed setup. The available SDN platform tools are then used to detect the anomalies.

The share in volatile energy sources connected through power electronic components increases, whereas the installed power of grid-connected generators and associated inertia decreases. In this context, critical operating states up to system blackouts, that threaten the security of supply and the access to electical energy, might occur. In order to restore the grid after a blackout in an efficient way, this paper proposes an advanced control concept for high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems using voltage source converters (VSC) in grid-forming mode. VSC-HVDC systems open new restoration paths and offer the possibility to involve healthy grid areas form a far distance to take part in the restoration process. To benefit from the potential of renewable energy sources and energy storage devices to support the process, established restoration strategies are extended by the consistent integration of power electronics and intelligent control schemes. The presented model predictive controller (MPC) enables precise voltage reference tracking inside the restoration area to ensure a grid compatible voltage ramp-up process by avoiding undesireable effects, e.g. inrush phenomena of transformers. Moreover, the grid frequency is used as a system-wide parameter that is used as a physical information channel between the grid-forming VSC-HVDC station and further power converters inside the restoration area. In that way, renewable energy sources and storage devices can contribute to speed up the restoration process while guaranteeing system stability.","","978-9-0758-1528-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8515409","Predictive control;Grid-forming;HVDC transmission;Grid restoration;Predictive reference tracking;Dynamic frequency adaption","Voltage control;Power conversion;HVDC transmission;Europe;Capacitors","HVDC power convertors;HVDC power transmission;intelligent control;optimal control;power grids;power system restoration;power transmission control;predictive control;renewable energy sources;voltage-source convertors","renewable energy sources;restoration process;system stability;frequency-adaptive MPC;grid-forming VSC-HVDC systems;optimal voltage reference tracking;grid restoration strategies gain;electrical power grids;volatile energy sources;grid-connected generators;critical operating states;system blackouts;electical energy;advanced control concept;high voltage direct current systems;voltage source converters;grid-forming mode;energy storage devices;power electronics;intelligent control schemes;precise voltage reference;grid compatible voltage ramp-up;grid frequency;system-wide parameter;grid-forming VSC-HVDC station;power converters;power electronic components;VSC-HVDC systems;restoration strategies;model predictive controller","","","","7","","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Failures of CPEs can occur in both their cyber and physical parts and may, in both cases, result in significant economic losses, service interruption and, even threats to the environment and the population. Traditionally, safety and security of CPEs are addressed separately, the former dealing with failures in the physical part, the latter with breaches in the cyber part. While physical aging is often accounted for, it is not for the cyber elements although it may have an impact on CPEs controllability, stability and, ultimately, reliability. In this paper, we propose a dynamic reliability assessment framework that embeds a multi-state cyber aging model of literature into a Goal Tree Success Tree-Master Logic Diagram (GTST-MLD) that accounts for both stochastic hardware components failures and cyber aging that may open breaches for cyber attacks to the control system. The digital Instrumentation and Control (I & C) system of the Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED) is considered as an example to show the applicability of the GTST-MLD based dynamic reliability assessment method proposed.","","978-1-6654-0049-7","10.1109/ICSRS53853.2021.9660671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660671","Cyber-Physical Energy system (CPEs);reliability;cyber aging;Goal Tree Success Tree (GTST);Master Logic Diagram (MLD);Digital Instrumentation and Control (I&C);Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED)","Instruments;Stochastic processes;Europe;Aging;Lead;Controllability;Hardware","ageing;belief networks;failure analysis;fission reactor coolants;fission reactor cooling;fission reactor design;fission reactor safety;liquid metal fast breeder reactors;reliability;security of data;stochastic processes;telecommunication network reliability;trees (mathematics)","dynamic reliability assessment framework;multistate cyber;cyber attacks;control system;GTST-MLD based dynamic reliability assessment method;cyber-Physical Energy systems;remotely controlled systems;energy production;physical aging;cyber elements;CPEs controllability;goal tree success tree-master logic diagram","","","","26","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among other vulnerabilities, presentation attacks directed to the capture device pose a severe security threat. That is, a gummy finger (known as presentation attack instrument, PAI) can be used to impersonate another subject and thereby gain illegal access to the system. To prevent such attacks, presentation attack detection (PAD) techniques have been proposed in the last decade. For the particular case of fingerprints, most approaches are based on conventional optical or capacitive sensors, acquiring a single image, and which can thus detect only a limited number of PAIs. In this work, we present a new multi-modal PAD approach based on a recently developed capture device, which is able to acquire four different types of samples: i) finger photos, ii) finger vein samples, iii) multi-spectral short wave infrared images, and iv) laser speckle contrast image sequence samples. Different ad-hoc algorithms have been developed for each set of images. The experimental evaluation over 35 PAIs, part of them used only at the test stage, shows the efficiency of the proposed approach in a realistic scenario, with an APCER of 6.6% for a BPCER of 0.2%.","","978-1-5386-9385-8","10.1109/SITIS.2018.00089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8706160","Fingerprint;Presentation Attack Detection;Mult-Modal;Biometrics;Security;PAD","Biometrics (access control);Veins;Sensors;Cameras;Speckle;Skin;Security","biomedical optical imaging;capacitive sensors;data privacy;fingerprint identification;image sequences;infrared imaging;medical image processing;security of data","multimodal PAD approach;finger vein samples;multimodal finger presentation attack detection;biometric verification systems;gummy finger;presentation attack instrument;capacitive sensors;optical sensors","","8","","27","IEEE","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It allows us to auto control electronic appliances in the house such as fans, lights, gates, doors, windows, and many more including security access systems and alarm systems. In this paper, we have implemented the operation of lights through the voice-controlled home automation system by giving voice commands as an input to the system for the user to turn ON and turn OFF the lights at home. The system mainly uses the Raspberry Pi module, which happens to be an important component of our smart light system implementation. It consists of both hardware and software components, which have a speech recognition module implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has voice commands that can be understood, and accordingly, lights can be operated with its usage. It has a special feature that when the light gets turned ON or OFF, it will be ensured to the user through an audio output by the speaker. The main working of a voice-automated system depends on the recognition of the voice given by the user as an input. Raspberry Pi module keeps all electrical home appliances connected through a single interface for complete smart home system automation. Today's modern world is shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems with less human intervention, as result, the use of manual operating switches is slowly deteriorating. In this paper, we have used voice recognition for operating the home appliances where there is no need to use the conventional switches, and hence human effort required for the system is comparatively very less. Research work on smart home systems mainly aims to satisfy the needs, which help elderly and disabled people etc. in operating home appliances without any helping support from others. The main purpose of our paper is to build a perfect smart home-helper for the users to operate the home appliances easily through voice commands.","","978-1-7281-5970-6","10.1109/ICSIDEMPC49020.2020.9299585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9299585","Smart Home System;Raspberry Pi;Voice Recognition","Smart homes;Home appliances;Internet;Control systems;Speech recognition;Communication system security;Wireless sensor networks","domestic appliances;home automation;intelligent control;Internet of Things;lighting control;microcontrollers;natural language processing;speech recognition;speech-based user interfaces","natural language processing;speech recognition module;smart home system automation;security access systems;smart home lighting system;voice recognition;centralized control systems;electrical home appliance control;smart light system;Raspberry Pi module;voice controlled home automation system;alarm systems","","3","","25","IEEE","1 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we explore the combination of three modalities (RGB, depth and skeleton data) to design a robust multi-modal framework for vision-based human activity recognition. Especially, spatial information, body shape/posture and temporal evolution of actions are highlighted using illustrative representations obtained from a combination of dynamic RGB images, dynamic depth images and skeleton data representations. Therefore, each video is represented with three images that summarize the ongoing action. Our framework takes advantage of transfer learning from pre-trained models to extract significant features from these newly created images. Next, we fuse extracted features using Canonical Correlation Analysis and train a Long Short-Term Memory network to classify actions from visual descriptive images. Experimental results demonstrated the reliability of our feature-fusion framework that allows us to capture highly significant features and enables us to achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the public UTD-MHAD and NTU RGB+D datasets.","1051-4651","978-1-7281-8808-9","10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9412863","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9412863","","Visualization;Correlation;Video sequences;Transfer learning;Activity recognition;Feature extraction;Video surveillance","computer vision;feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image fusion;image motion analysis;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);video signal processing;video surveillance","vision-based multimodal framework;action recognition;intelligent systems;video surveillance;public security;health care;home monitoring;real-time systems;human activities;accurately unusual behaviors;dangerous situations;robust multimodal framework;vision-based human activity recognition;illustrative representations;dynamic RGB images;dynamic depth images;skeleton data representations;ongoing action;newly created images;visual descriptive images;feature-fusion framework","","2","","31","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key solution to achieve this goal is to integrate multiple avionic systems, apply new signal processing and RF capabilities. A generalized and reconfigurable architecture of Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) with integrated and modularised structure based on Direct RF Sampling (DRFS) and Software Defined Radio (SDR) is presented in this paper for avionic applications. The proposed architecture is composed of a DRFS digital receiver integrated within a SDR software modules. DRFS technology is adopted in the digital receiver, which consists of Pre-selection Filters and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to provide flexible compatibility for diverse modulation modes and various RF/IF frequency bands. By employing the concept of DRFS/SDR, distinct procedures for different avionic purposes, such as Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing System (ILS), can be achieved in the same hardware platform. Notably, this proposed architecture has the potential to be reconfigured and improved in several ways without any hardware change to accommodate new features and signal capabilities. As per experimental validation phase, an MMR integrated system for VOR and ILS receivers has been designed and implemented. Test results have illustrated that the implementation feasibility of multi-mode DRFS avionic receivers is beneficial and efficient using the proposed architecture. Moreover, the benefits obtained from this new approach are not only covering miniaturization, lightweight, and low power consumption but is also promising to overreach the equivalent commercial systems in the future.","2375-5318","978-1-4673-8823-8","10.1109/RADAR.2017.7944467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7944467","Avionic;DRFS;SDR;MMR;IMA;VHF;VOR;ILS","Aerospace electronics;Receivers;Radio frequency;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Band-pass filters;Mixers","avionics;instrument landing systems;radio receivers;software radio","direct RF sampling;avionic systems;VOR;ILS receiver;aerospace industry;avionic architecture;cost reduction;weight reduction;maintenance complexity;RF efficiency;signal processing;generalized architecture;reconfigurable architecture;multimode receiver;MMR;integrated structure;modularised structure;software defined radio;SDR;DRFS digital receiver;SDR software modules;pre-selection filters;field programmable gate arrays;FPGA;flexible compatibility;diverse modulation modes;RF-IF frequency bands;very-high-frequency omnidirectional range;instrument landing system;hardware platform;MMR integrated system;multimode DRFS avionic receivers;power consumption","","6","","16","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

New architecture and designs are required for the in-vehicle systems to address these emerging concerns. Early design decisions have a large impact on the required functionalities as well as the quality attributes of these systems. Understanding the impact of design decisions on the system quality is crucial for successful system development. It is difficult to estimate the requirements for safety (at an early development stage) considering the innovation aspect of automated driving. These safety requirements have a considerable influence on project planning and development cost. Therefore, it is important for the industry to understand the decision points and their impact on system design. In this article, we share our experience on understanding the impact of early design decisions on safety requirements. We particularly discuss the impact of design decisions regarding the operational design domain on (functional) safety. We provide two automated driving systems as discussion cases and investigate the impact of the operational situation on the safety requirements such as safe state and degraded operating mode. We show how posting small constraints on the operational situation can result in simplification of the sensor and actuator requirements of these systems.","2472-9647","978-1-5386-8396-5","10.1109/SYSCON.2019.8836917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8836917","","Safety;Vehicles;Automation;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Planning;Task analysis","battery powered vehicles;mobile computing;road safety;traffic engineering computing","automated driving systems;safety requirements;actuator requirements;quality attributes;in-vehicle systems;system quality;decision points;system design;operational design domain;automated driving","","1","","17","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given challenges of verification by simulation of these complex systems have made the huge number of possible states of carrying operation, and to ensure reliability requirements, we propose a formal proof verification as an alternative operation and validation blocks against defects through one proposed self-adaptive fault tolerance paradigm suitable for occurred errors of networked embedded systems. The formalization process based on an incremental and validated correct-by-construction development of the proposed reliability mechanisms are designed and proved in order to ensure accuracy operating required related dependability of communication wireless networked systems.","","978-1-4799-6773-5","10.1109/CoDIT.2014.6996987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6996987","","Color;Peer-to-peer computing;IP networks;Reliability;Vectors;Wireless communication;System-on-chip","embedded systems;fault tolerance;formal specification;formal verification;integrated circuit reliability;large-scale systems;system-on-chip","formal specification;formal verification;wireless networked systems on chip;self-organized systems on chip;run time data exchanges;preventing faults;associated errors;degraded operating modes;global system failures;fault tolerant mechanism;security mechanism;complex systems;reliability requirements;formal proof verification;self-adaptive fault tolerance paradigm;networked embedded systems;formalization process;reliability mechanisms;communication wireless networked systems","","1","","22","IEEE","29 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We exploit the innovative idea of Public Physical Unclonable Functions (PPUFs) that fundamentally protects attackers from recovering the secret key from public gate delay information. We implement its hardware logic in a real-world FPGA board. On top of the PPUF fingerprint hardware, we present an adaptive security control mechanism consisting of adaptive key generation and key exchange protocol, which adjusts security strength depending on system load dynamics. We demonstrate that our PPUF FPGA implementation embeds distinctive variability enough to distinguish between two different PPUFs with high fidelity. We validate our PUFSec architecture by implementing necessary algorithms and protocols in a real-world IoT platform, and performing empirical evaluation in terms of computation and memory usages, proving its practical feasibility.","","978-1-5090-5336-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057146","","Hardware;Logic gates;Delays;Cryptography;Software;Radiation detectors","cryptographic protocols;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;Internet of Things;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;telecommunication security","low-end embedded platform;security enhancement;computation overhead;IoT devices;intrinsic hardware characteristics;computationally lightweight security software system architecture;complex cryptography computation;Public Physical Unclonable Functions;secret key;public gate delay information;hardware logic;real-world FPGA board;PPUF fingerprint hardware;adaptive security control mechanism;adaptive key generation;key exchange protocol;security strength;system load dynamics;PPUF FPGA implementation;PUFSec architecture;real-world IoT platform;device fingerprint-based security architecture;Internet of Things","","9","","13","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the rapid changes in technology, these security measure's abuse and theft are also increasing. This led to the birth of the biometric security system, in which the identity verification of individuals is performed based on the feature vectors, which are derived from the physiological and/or behavioral characteristics of humans. The categorization of a biometric system is done as per the number of traits utilization for authentication purposes. There are various available methods for identification such as Face Recognition, Iris Recognition, Voice Recognition, Fingerprint Recognition, etc. As per advancement in technology, information security becomes a major challenge of the IT industry. Thus, authentication plays an important role to deals with security. The key objective of this scheme is to ensure that the rendered services are accessible only by the authorized user and not by an illegal person. Using biometrics, an individual's identity can be confirmed or established. In this paper, a comparative survey of uni and the multi-modal biometric system is presented, and analysis is performed to know the best system. The purpose is to analyze the latest technology based on the progress made and unresolved issues.

Biometric security becomes a positive solution, adopted for many identification problems in various sectors, including Aviation. As the avionics business keeps growing worldwide, air terminals face the difficulties of increasingly more passenger volumes; with that, travelers' desire for a secure and consistent pass through the airport terminals is just expanding. COVID-19 has managed a hit in all parts of our lives. Maintaining social distance and wearing masks are very important in maintaining a person's health in this pandemic situation. In this scenario, facial recognition for passenger identification is difficult and tends to false acceptance of passengers with identical faces. To address this issue, contactless biometric traits like iris and fingerprints are considered for security growth. The paper deals with the fusion of iris and fingerprint to identify passengers without removing the masks and promotes safe travel. The iris and fingerprint features are extracted using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM) and cross number technique. Maintaining these templates requires more space for storage. To make this simple, Sparse autoencoder, an unsupervised deep learning technique is incorporated on the fused template for attaining the dimensionality reduction. A minimum cost matcher(MCM) is employed to increase the multimodal biometric system's accuracy and performance. Thus, the proposed system honors passenger security builds confidence in air travel, and also strives for economic growth.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438214","","Dimensionality reduction;Deep learning;COVID-19;Pandemics;Face recognition;Fingerprint recognition;Retina","airports;avionics;biometrics (access control);deep learning (artificial intelligence);face recognition;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;image fusion;iris recognition;unsupervised learning","unsupervised deep learning;fused template;dimensionality reduction;multimodal biometric system;passenger security;air travel;sparse autoencoder;number technique;fingerprint features;safe travel;security growth;iris;contactless biometric traits;identical faces;passenger identification;facial recognition;pandemic situation;wearing masks;social distance;COVID-19;airport terminals;secure pass;travelers;passenger volumes;air terminals;avionics business;aviation;identification problems;biometric security;multimodal biometrics;dimensional reduction","","1","","34","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In spite of their high detection rates on the LivDet databases, the vast majority of the methods rely on the samples provided by traditional capture devices, which may fail to detect more sophisticated presentation attack instrument (PAI) species. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal fingerprint PAD which relies on an analysis of: i) the surface of the finger within the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, and ii) the inside of the finger thanks to the laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) technology. On the experimental evaluation over a database comprising more than 4700 samples and 35 PAI species, and including unknown attacks to model a realistic scenario, a Detection Equal Error Rate (D-EER) of 0.5% has been achieved.

It is based upon the ever-secure Advanced Encryption Standard Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) mode of encryption and Indexing-First One (IFO) hashing for the generation of the secret keys. The proposed system utilizes two biometrics of the user, the iris and the fingerprint, but instead of using the features of the biometrics directly, they are hashed through the IFO process to create a secret key that can be revoked and regenerated in case of a compromise ensuring the security of the users biometrics. The IFO hashes obtained from the biometric feature vectors are then used as two different secret keys in a two round AES-CBC system to encrypt the medical image. The medical image can be decrypted by performing the AES-CBC rounds in reverse with the correct keys, meaning that with high probability, only the correct user will be able to decrypt the image. This encryption technique improves upon many existing medical encryption schemes based on biometrics, which do not take the protection of the biometric template into account. We were able to perform one full key generation, encryption and decryption in.027 seconds. In addition, this processes is lossless, meaning that there is no change in the pixels of the medical image during the encryption or decryption process, which is necessary of a medical image encryption system.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377901","Arkansas Research Alliance; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377901","Encryption;Medical Images;Biometrics;Template Protection;Image security;AES-CBC","Image coding;Biometrics (access control);Big Data;Encryption;Standards;Biomedical imaging;Iris recognition","biometrics (access control);fingerprint identification;indexing;iris recognition;medical image processing;private key cryptography;vectors","IFO hashing;biometric feature vectors;secret keys;AES-CBC system;decryption process;medical image encryption system;cancelable multimodal biometric;medical encryption schemes;encryption process;advanced encryption standard cipher block chaining system;indexing first one hashing;fingerprint biometric;iris biometric","","2","","34","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An initial study has concluded that the use of a hybrid ESS/wind farm under the NETA conditions would result in an increase in operating revenue. However preliminary protection investigations have highlighted concerns over appropriate control and protection under the particular scenarios of a change in operating mode from load (i.e. as an electrolyser) to a generator (i.e. to a fuel cell) and vice versa. Work is continuing to produce more detailed modelling results of such a system.

A joint reserve scheduling model considering the cross-sectorial impacts of operation uncertainties is essential but still insufficient to guarantee the reliable operation of the integrated electricity and natural gas system (IEGS). Therefore, this paper proposes a day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model for the IEGS to schedule the operation and reserve si-multaneously considering reliability requirements. Firstly, the multi-state models for generating units and gas wells are established. Based on the multi-state models, the expected unserved energy cost (EUEC) and the expected wind curtailment cost (EWC) criteria are proposed based on probabilistic methods considering wind fluctuation and random failures of components in IEGS. Furthermore, the EUEC and EWC criteria are incorporated into the day-ahead SCUC model, which is noncon-vex and mathematically reformulated into a solvable mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem. The proposed model is validated using an IEEE 30-bus system and Belgium 20-node natural gas system. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively schedule the energy reserve to guarantee the reliable operation of the IEGS considering the multiple uncertainties in different subsystems and the cross-sectorial failure propagation.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2021.000028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584449","Integrated electricity and natural gas system (IEGS);natural gas reserve;electric reserve;expected unserved energy cost;expected wind curtailment;multi-state model;operational reliability","Reliability;Power system reliability;Natural gas;Uncertainty;Wind power generation;Probabilistic logic;Modeling","concave programming;demand side management;integer programming;natural gas technology;power generation dispatch;power generation reliability;power generation scheduling;probability;thermal power stations","Belgium 20-node natural gas system;cross-sectorial failure propagation;cross-sectorial impacts;day-ahead SCUC model;day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment model;EUEC criteria;EWC criteria;expected unserved energy cost criteria;expected wind curtailment cost criteria;gas well systems;IEEE 30-bus system;IEGS;integrated electricity and natural gas system;joint reserve scheduling model;MISOCP problem;mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem;multistate models;optimal energy reserve scheduling;reliability requirements;wind fluctuation","","","","31","","22 Oct 2021","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Given its appealing usability, such zero-effort authentication has already been deployed in the real-world where a computer terminal or a vehicle can be unlocked by the mere proximity of an authentication token (e.g., a smartphone). However, existing systems based on a single authentication factor contains one major security weakness - unauthorized physical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the attacker to have unfettered access to the terminal. We introduce ZEMFA, a zero-effort multi-factor authentication system based on multiple authentication tokens and multi-modal behavioral biometrics. Specifically, ZEMFA utilizes two types of authentication tokens, a smartphone and a smartwatch (or a bracelet) and two types of gait patterns captured by these tokens, mid/lower body movements measured by the phone and wrist/arm movements captured by the watch. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is believed to be unique, only that user (no impostor) would be able to gain access to the terminal even when the impostor is given access to both of the authentication tokens. We present the design and implementation of ZEMFA. We demonstrate that ZEMFA offers a high degree of detection accuracy, based on multi-sensor and multi-device fusion. We also show that ZEMFA can resist active attacks that attempt to mimic a user's walking pattern, especially when multiple devices are used.","2643-4202","978-1-7281-3265-5","10.1109/PST47121.2019.8949032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949032","Authentication;Biometrics;Walking-pattern;Phone;Wearables;Sensors;Context","","authorisation;biometrics (access control);gait analysis;mobile computing;smart phones","ZEMFA;multimodal gait biometrics;zero-effort authentication;authentication token;single authentication factor;zero-effort multifactor authentication system;multisensor fusion;multidevice fusion","","4","","55","IEEE","6 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an adaptive security-aware scheduling system for packet switched networks using a real-time multi-agent design model. The proposed system combines real-time scheduling with security service enhancement. The scheduling unit uses the differentiated-earliest-deadline-first (Diff-EDF) scheduler and the security enhancement scheme adopts a congestion control mechanism. The required QoS is guaranteed for different types (audio and video) of real-time data flows, while the packet security levels are adaptively enhanced according to the feedbacks from the congestion control module. Compared with the IPsec protocol, the proposed scheme reduces the number of pending packets at the destinations. In implementation, the proposed scheme can overload the priority code point and the virtual-LAN identifier fields of the IEEE 802.1Q frame format, hence eliminating the overhead of the security associations performed by the IPsec protocol.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.071813.120299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565569","Multi-agent systems;quality of service (QoS);real-time scheduling;network security;resource estimation","Quality of service;Real-time systems;Scheduling;Multi-agent systems;Authentication;Packet switching","computer network security;local area networks;multi-agent systems;quality of service;real-time systems;scheduling;telecommunication congestion control","real-time scheduling;packet switched networks;real-time network applications;quality of service;timing constraints;security requirements;adaptive security-aware scheduling system;real-time multiagent design model;security service enhancement;differentiated-earliest-deadline-first scheduler;Diff-EDF scheduler;congestion control mechanism;packet security levels;pending packets;priority code point;virtual-LAN identifier fields;IEEE 802.1Q frame format","","12","","43","IEEE","23 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Risk-aware, real-time security constrained economic dispatch (RT-SCED) provides an efficient solution towards promptly, economically and robustly responding to the changes in the power system operating state. Despite different model-based methods have been developed to handle uncertainties, significant computation burden arise to incorporate $N$-1 contingency constraints with a higher temporal resolution in RT-SCED. Driven by similar computational challenges, risk evaluation is often overlooked in the current application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based data-driven methods in RT-SCED. This paper proposes a DRL-based risk-aware RT-SCED methodological framework by incorporating a novel data-driven risk evaluation model to foster efficient agent-environment interactions. The real-time dispatch policies are constructed with an improved twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient method. The policy network features a residual network architecture and incorporates an active power allocation mechanism to integrate empirical dispatch knowledge, preventing early termination and fostering more efficient learning behavior. Case studies validate the superior performance of the proposed method in risk-aware RT-SCED on cost efficiency, uncertainty adaptability and computational efficiency, through benchmarking against model-based and data-driven baseline methods.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3288039","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52207082); International Cooperation and Exchange Programme of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52261145704); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20220842); Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Smart Grid Technology and Equipment, Southeast University(grant numbers:4216002201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10158041","Data-driven methods;deep reinforcement learning;knowledge-integrated learning;power system risk evaluation;real-time security constrained economic dispatch","Contingency management;Uncertainty;Reactive power;Costs;Real-time systems;Load shedding;Load modeling","","","","","","","IEEE","20 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A multi-robot system performing exploration can be highly beneficial for this purpose by distributing the work amongst the different robots. In this paper, we present a distributed approach to multi-robot exploration which always keeps all the robots in communication range. The algorithm is based on a utility function that guarantees communication while using best effort for the exploration itself. The robots randomly sample configuration changes of the overall system, i.e., the set of the next best joined movements based on this utility function. This process can be very well distributed with very few communication overhead by having each robot computing a part of the sample and broadcasting its best candidate configuration change found. The globally best candidate among the broadcasted ones is then executed by the team. The algorithm is tested in a high-fidelity marine robotics simulator including realistic vehicle physics and proper underlying software for mapping, path-planning, and motion-control.","2374-3247","978-1-61284-769-6","10.1109/SSRR.2011.6106767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6106767","Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV);Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV);exploration;multi robot coordination;utility based control;underwater communication","Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Heuristic algorithms;System recovery;Underwater vehicles;Bandwidth","mobile robots;motion control;multi-robot systems;path planning;remotely operated vehicles;underwater vehicles","distributed communicative exploration;underwater communication constraint;unmanned underwater vehicle;safety security and rescue robotics;military reconnaissance;marine search and rescue;mine hunting;multi-robot exploration;utility function;high-fidelity marine robotics;mapping;path planning;motion control","","8","","30","IEEE","19 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Papalexopoulos","ECCO International, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA","IEEE Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting,","26 Sep 2005","2002","3","","1168 vol.3","","Summary form only given as follows. The FERC in its RTO Order 2000 reaffirms the requirement that an RTO must (1) encourage market-motivated operating and investment actions for preventing and relieving congestion; (2) accommodate efforts by state regulatory commissions to create multi-state agreements to review and approve new transmission facilities, coordinated with programs of existing Regional Transmission Groups (RTGs) where necessary; and (3) file a plan with the FERC with specified milestones that will ensure that it meets the overall planning and expansion requirement no later than three years after initial operation, if the RTO is unable to satisfy this requirement when it commences operation. In the alternative, the RTO must demonstrate that an alternative proposal is consistent with or superior to these three requirements. The FERC expresses its preference for market-based plans, and noted that the pricing mechanisms and actions used by the RTO as part of its transmission planning and expansion program should be compatible with the pricing signals for shorter-term solutions to transmission constraints (i.e., congestion management) so that market participants can choose the least-cost response. Development and implementation of transmission projects remains a major challenge in the new competitive environment. Alternative business models including RTOs, and Transcos have been proposed as the best infrastructure under which appropriate transmission investments can be made to ensure the security of the transmission grid at least cost. This presentation discusses the various analytical approaches for evaluating prospective transmission projects. Two areas of particular difficulty are also discussed. These are: dealing with uncertainty and the interdependence of transmission and generation investment. Finally, the incorporation of market power in the wholesale electricity market into the transmission evaluation process is also discussed.","","0-7803-7518-1","10.1109/PESS.2002.1043470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1043470","","Power system planning;Pricing;Investments;Meeting planning;Proposals;Security;Costs;Uncertainty;Electricity supply industry","power transmission planning;power transmission economics;investment;costing;power markets","FERC;power system expansion planning;power system pricing;deregulated environment;RTO Order 2000;market-motivated operating actions;market-motivated investment actions;congestion prevention;congestion relief;state regulatory commissions;new transmission facilities approval;Regional Transmission Groups;market-based plans;pricing mechanisms;transmission constraints;congestion management;least-cost response;uncertainty;generation investment;transmission investment;wholesale electricity market;transmission evaluation process","","2","","","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two key lessons learned are as follows. First, other than inheriting vulnerabilities from the previous generations, 6G has new threat vectors from new radio technologies, such as the exposed location of radio stripes in ultra-massive MIMO systems at Terahertz bands and attacks against pervasive intelligence. Second, physical layer protection, deep network slicing, quantum-safe communications, artificial intelligence (AI) security, platform-agnostic security, real-time adaptive security, and novel data protection mechanisms such as distributed ledgers and differential privacy are the top promising techniques to mitigate the attack magnitude and personal data breaches substantially.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2021.3108618","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan(grant numbers:110-2811-E-194-501-MY2,108-2221-E-194-022-MY3,108-2221-E-194-019-MY3); Advanced Institute of Manufacturing with High-Tech Innovations (AIM-HI) through the Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan; Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) of Vietnam and Thai Nguyen University(grant numbers:B2021-TNA-02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524814","6G;security and privacy;AI security;physical layer security;connection security;service security","Security;6G mobile communication;Privacy;5G mobile communication;Computer architecture;Systematics;Standards","6G mobile communication;artificial intelligence;data privacy;MIMO communication;mobile computing;security of data","accessible user information explosion;privacy issues;security architectures;threat vectors;radio technologies;physical layer protection;deep network slicing;platform-agnostic security;real-time adaptive security;differential privacy;sixth-generation mobile networks;6G mobile networks;diverse threats;space-air-ground integrated network environment;ultra-massive MIMO system;quantum-safe communication;artificial intelligence security;data protection","","77","","251","IEEE","30 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, allowing remote configuration changes entail the following security issues. Malicious configuration updates through unprotected configuration interfaces can physically harm the ICPS or the respective process, and even threaten human lives. Also, for configuration interfaces to be remotely accessible, corporate networks need to be configured accordingly to provide access possibilities. Such additional access possibilities might then be used by adversaries when attacking corporate networks and thus, are often seen as a security weakness. If ICPS are not updated, outdated configurations also lead to security weaknesses. To mitigate these issues, we present a secured remote configuration approach for ICPS that protects the configuration interface as well as configuration data.

As a result, failures of any network component, such as a transmission line or power generator, can be critical to the overall grid operation. The security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) aims for the long term precontingency operating state, such that in the event of any contingency, the power grid will remain secure. For a realistic power network, however, with numerous contingencies considered, the overall problem size becomes intractable for single-core optimization tools in short time frames established by real-time industrial operations. We propose a parallel distributed memory structure exploiting framework, BELTISTOS-SC, which accelerates the solution of SCOPF problems over state of the art techniques. The acceleration on single-core execution is achieved by a structure-exploiting interior point method, employing successive Schur complement evaluations to further reduce the size of the systems solved at each iteration while maintaining sparsity, resulting in lower computational resources for the linear system solution. Additionally the parallel, distributed memory implementation of the proposed framework is also presented in detail and validated through several large-scale examples, demonstrating its efficiency for large-scale SCOPF problems.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2942964","Swiss Innovation Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8846109","Security constraints;optimal power flow;non-linear programming;interior point method;parallel algorithms","Generators;Security;Power transmission lines;Optimization;Power grids;Acceleration;Linear programming","distributed memory systems;iterative methods;load flow;optimisation;power engineering computing;power grids;power system security;renewable energy sources","single-core optimization tools;real-time industrial operations;parallel distributed memory structure exploiting framework;linear system solution;large-scale SCOPF problems;security constrained optimal power flow problems;renewable energy;power grid equipment;transmission line;power generator;long term precontingency operating state;realistic power network;two level parallel augmented Schur complement interior-point algorithms;BELTISTOS-SC;iteration method","","15","","34","IEEE","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The secret keys are generated adaptively using correlated channel estimation, which reckons on the randomness in the environment and does not require the secrecy of data transferred during the process. This concept is extended in UWA channels with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems and implements a protocol to generate secret keys adaptively based on the channel frequency response (CFR). A secret key generated from the CFR estimation manages the channel coding system, namely a turbo-code. This scheme allows to jointly performing an error control and adaptive coding in only one step. This scheme allows an adaptive security coding without change of the hardware structure of the transceiver devices.

The need for high availability and reliability of these systems is therefore the pillar guiding our research. This paper proposes the adoption of anomaly detection as a method to support self-adaptation in CPPS and to ensure flexibility, reliability, and protection of industrial environments against modern cyber threats. An anomaly detection mechanism can be employed to monitor, and learn the normal behavior of an industrial system, and to generate alerts when the observed events indicate abnormal activities. On this concept we base our work, and we demonstrate how timely identifying critical security events can enable, through the self-adaptation (e.g., triggering automatic configuration changes), an efficient protection of the CPPS against advanced threats, and an effective containment of their effects.","","978-1-5386-6531-2","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387655","Cyber Physical Production Systems;Self-adaptation;Anomaly Detection;Industry 4.0","Security;Monitoring;Anomaly detection;Measurement;Industries;Sensors;Planning","cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;security of data;self-adjusting systems","anomaly detection mechanism;productivity;IoT;Internet of Things;CPPS self-adaptation;Industry 4.0;cyber physical production systems protection;cloud computing;industrial processes;fourth industrial revolution;financial loss;cyber-threats","","18","","19","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The distribution network reconfiguration technique is often performed to improve these voltage levels, if not to reduce power losses. However, distribution systems feed various kinds of consumers, and their power demand dependency on bus voltages is different based on their load type. Modifying the network configuration changes the system's nodal voltage levels, and then the load power is also impacted after the reconfiguration. Only a few research works in the field of distribution system reconfiguration have included load power dependency to nodal voltages in their proposed models. However, these studies have not discussed whether adding voltage-depend loads to the reconfiguration problem is beneficial or only increases the computational efforts without substantial gains on the optimal solution. With the intention to fill this gap, this article develops a comprehensive analysis of how the change of load according to the voltage affects reconfiguration solutions. This investigation aims to help distribution system researchers and readers understand this phenomenon and highlight the benefits and drawbacks of taking it into account. Also, a robust reconfiguration model for considering load types and nodal voltage is proposed. The model is validated in different network models and sizes, where the obtained results are compared with other models presented in the literature. The results analysis indicates that voltage fluctuations impact the distribution network configuration through voltage effect on power losses and the system nodal loads. Also, load voltage-dependent models are more flexible than constant demand based-formulations in finding feasible solutions in more restricted voltage tolerances.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2023.3278801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10142233","Distribution system;load type;network re-configuration;power demand;voltage fluctuations","Load modeling;Voltage;Mathematical models;Computational modeling;Distribution networks;Analytical models;Voltage control","","","","","","","IEEE","1 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Therefore, management of these devices is becoming increasingly important to network operators. Existing network monitoring technologies perform traffic analysis using specialized acceleration on network switches, or full inspection of packets in software, which can be complex, expensive, inflexible, and unscalable. In this paper, we use SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs, classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks).","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.2971213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8981946","IoT;device monitoring;flow characteristics;machine learning","Monitoring;Telemetry;Performance evaluation;Object recognition;Machine learning;Cameras;Internet of Things","computer network security;firmware;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic;telemetry","nonIoTs;real traffic traces;IoT cyber-security;cyber-security risks;Internet of Things devices;network operators;network monitoring technologies;network switches;programmable flow-based telemetry;flexible data-driven models;network activity;traffic flows;network behavior;real consumer IoT devices;flow-level attributes;SDN paradigm;machine learning;time-series attributes;firmware upgrade;cyber attacks","","38","","57","IEEE","4 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a dynamic feature, lip reading feature is not easy to imitate, and can be collected with face information at the same time, so it has high convenience. Fusion of lip reading and face information can improve the accuracy of the authentication system, at the same time, greatly enhance the anti-counterfeiting ability of the recognition system.

Aker provides a firmware generation tool and a property-driven security verification methodology to ensure that the ACWs are properly integrated and configured. Aker security verification confirms that the ACW behaves properly at IP level. It verifies the hardware root of trust firmware configures the ACW correctly.

In turn, machine learning can be used to construct surrogate models approximating the system's security boundary in the region of operation. To this end, past system history can be useful for generating anticipated system states suitable for training. However, inferring the underlying data model, to allow high-density sampling, is problematic due to the large number of variables, their complex marginal probability distributions and the nonlinear dependence structure they exhibit. In this paper, we adopt the C-Vine pair-copula decomposition scheme; clustering and principal component transformation stages are introduced, followed by a truncation to the pairwise dependency modeling, enabling efficient fitting and sampling of large datasets. Using measurements from the French grid, we show that a machine learning training database sampled from the proposed method can produce binary security classifiers with superior predictive capability compared to other approaches.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2859367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418852","Copulas;data clustering;machine learning;Monte Carlo simulation;parametric statistics;principal component analysis;risk assessment;stochastic dependence;uncertainty analysis","Computational modeling;Security;Load modeling;Stochastic processes;Machine learning;Training;Data models","inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power engineering computing;power grids;power system security;principal component analysis;sampling methods;statistical distributions","electricity system operation;marginal probability distributions;representative system states;data model inference;principal component transformation stage;clustering stage;French grid;binary security classifiers;pairwise dependency modeling;C-Vine pair-copula decomposition scheme;nonlinear dependence structure;high-density sampling;surrogate models;machine learning","","29","","44","IEEE","24 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the fluctuating renewable generation could lead to time-varying alternative gas injections. Then, the gas composition in the gas system may become uncertain, increasing the short-term risk of the integrated power-gas systems during the operation. This paper proposes a short-term reliability assessment approach for IPGS with alternative gas injections. First, the multi-performance and multi-state universal generating functions (UGF) are constructed to efficiently model the short-term reliability of the power-to-gas facility and the wind farm, respectively. Then, a reliability management UGF operator is proposed to minimize both load shedding and gas security violation. A set of novel reliability indices is proposed to comprehensively assess the gas security violations under uncertain gas compositions. Moreover, an analytical short-term reliability assessment approach is proposed, where the state-based sequential approximation and state-based McCormick envelope techniques are tailored and embedded. By optimizing the solution order by the system states, the nonconvexities in the reliability management optimization problem can be handled tractably without increasing the computation burden. Finally, the IEEE 24 bus Reliability Test System and the Belgium gas system are used to validate the proposed approach.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2023.3286821","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China(grant numbers:BK20220261); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154141","integrated power and gas systems;gas composition;hydrogen;short-term reliability;renewable energy;power-to-gas","Hydrogen;Reliability;Methane;Production;Power system reliability;Renewable energy sources;Security","","","","2","","","IEEE","16 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Isolation of tenants is essential for a stable and secure operation of a factory. Application upgrades and novel software enable faster innovation cycles. Secure remote management allows more outsourcing to third parties but leads to continuously changing factory networks. Mobile or even autonomous devices again add complexity. However, current factory owners are conservative for good reasons: changing a well-designed system is costly and may cause failures and outages of the production lines. The virtual tenant network (VTN) concept addresses this conflict by means of combining network virtualization, hardware virtualization, cloud technologies and IT automation. Thus, tenants are isolated and configuration changes or security breaches in one tenant will not affect others. The concept at hand borrows from data center technology but adopts those ideas to the embedded world of industrial networks.","","978-1-7281-0568-0","10.1109/NetSys.2019.8854508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854508","virtual tenant network;edge-cloud;multi-tenant;industrial communication","Production facilities;Couplings;Cloud computing;Quality of service;Security;Stakeholders;Virtualization","cloud computing;computer centres;factory automation;mobile computing;virtualisation","stable operation;secure operation;application upgrades;secure remote management;factory networks;network virtualization;configuration changes;security breaches;multitenant networks;automation industry;future industrial networks;innovation cycles;autonomous devices;virtual tenant network concept","","","","12","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, this paper presents an approach to evaluate the impacts of the HVDC link outage on the reliability of interconnected power system considering the frequency regulation process during system contingencies. Firstly, a multi-state model of an HVDC link with different available loading rates (ALRs) is established based on its reliability network. Then, dynamic frequency response models of the inter- connected power system are presented and integrated with a novel frequency regulation scheme enabled by the HVDC link. The proposed scheme exploits the temporary overload capability of normal converters to compensate for the imbalanced power during system contingencies. Moreover, it offers frequency support that enables the frequency regulation reserves of the sending-end and receiving-end power systems to be mutually available. Several indices are established to measure the system reliability based on the given models in terms of abnormal frequency duration, frequency deviation, and energy losses of the frequency regulation process during system contingencies. Finally, a modified two-area reliability test system (RTS) with an HVDC link is adopted to verify the proposed approach.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2021.000491","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51807173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9682650","Reliability;multi-state modeling;interconnected power system;high-voltage direct current (HVDC) link;frequency regulation","HVDC transmission;Reliability;Power system reliability;Frequency control;Power systems;Power system stability;Maintenance engineering","frequency control;frequency response;HVDC power convertors;HVDC power transmission;power generation control;power grids;power system interconnection;power system security;reliability","abnormal frequency duration;dynamic frequency response models;frequency deviation;frequency regulation reserves;frequency regulation scheme;frequency security;frequency support;high-voltage direct current;HVDC link outage;HVDC links considering frequency regulation process;imbalanced power;interconnected power system;receiving-end power systems;reliability assessment;reliability network;reliability performances;system contingencies;system reliability;two-area reliability test system","","","","30","","14 Jan 2022","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

However, in robot applications, the conditions are far severer compared to the traditional biometric security systems. The robots should be able to recognize users non-intrusively, which confines the available biometric features to face and voice. Also, the robots are expected to recognize users from relatively afar, which inevitably deteriorates the accuracy of each recognition module. In this paper, we tried to improve the overall accuracy by integrating the evidences issued by independently developed face and speaker recognition modules. Each recognition module exhibits different statistical characteristics in representing its confidence of the recognition. Therefore, it is essential to transform the evidences to a normalized form to integrate the results. This paper introduces a novel approach to integrate mutually independent multiple evidences to achieve an improved performance. Typical approach to this problem is to model the statistical characteristics of the evidences by well-known parametric form such as Gaussian. Using Mahalanobis distance is a good example. However, the characteristics of the evidences often do not fit into the parametric models, which results in performance degradation. To overcome this problem, we adopted a discrete PDF that can model the statistical characteristics as it is. To confirm the validity of the proposed method, we used a multi-modal database that consists of 10 registered users and 550 probe data. Each probe data contains face image and voice signal. Face and speaker recognition modules are applied to generate respective evidences. The experiment showed an improvement of 11.27% in accuracy compared to the individual recognizers, which is 2.72% better than the traditional Mahalanobis distance approach.","1944-9437","978-1-4244-1634-9","10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4415170","","Speaker recognition;Probability density function;Biometrics;Character recognition;Probes;Intelligent robots;Service robots;Security;Face recognition;Speech recognition","biometrics (access control);face recognition;Gaussian processes;intelligent robots;probability;robot vision;service robots;speaker recognition","face recognition systems;speaker recognition systems;discrete probability density function;user recognition;intelligent service robots;biometric security systems;Gaussian parametric;Mahalanobis distance;statistical characteristics","","1","","10","IEEE","16 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

""Having Divided to Conquer We Must Reunite [to] Rule"". Decomposition of problems and systems into smaller, more manageable units has been at the heart of software engineering practice for decades. ""Separation of concerns"" gives software engineers the conceptual and practical tools to focus their attention, and their tools, on the parts of the problem or solution to which they are best suited. Perhaps one of the earliest boundaries used to separate concerns is that which exists between hardware and software - once that boundary is drawn, software engineers were able to focus their attention on the development of software within the hardware boundaries chosen. There has however, been a steady erosion of such boundaries: digital and physical connectivity have become the norm, and increasingly such connectivity can be ad hoc, spontaneous, and often unplanned (perhaps best exemplified by the Internet of Things paradigm). Moreover, the fluid and disappearing boundaries between technology and people have radically affected social behaviours (again, perhaps well exemplified by the proliferation of mobile and ubiquitous computing such as wearable and 'smart' technologies used in variety of personal and community settings). Such convergence between digital, physical, and social spaces has provided exciting opportunities for software engineers to, literally, 'cross boundaries', and, as a result, to have an impact on the physical and social worlds in which the software they build will operate. But in this brave new world with porous boundaries, security engineering and privacy management challenges abound. Effective security depends on the ability to control access to assets protected by boundaries. Effective privacy management depends on informed, consensual sharing of information across boundaries. Our thesis is that, although increasingly invisible, and rightly so, explicit awareness and sometimes representation of boundaries in cyber-physical-social systems facilitate good old fashioned separation of concerns, which in turn enables more effective software engineering of secure, privacy-aware software. We support our thesis with examples from our research in adaptive security and privacy.","","978-1-5386-4043-2","10.1109/SEsCPS.2017.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968016","adaptive security and privacy;cyber-physical-social systems","Software;Security;Privacy;Software engineering;Tools;Conferences;Cyber-physical systems","software engineering","crossing boundaries;digital spaces;physical spaces;social spaces;software engineering practice;software engineers;physical connectivity;Internet of Things;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing;wearable;smart technologies;porous boundaries;security engineering;privacy management;cyber-physical-social systems;privacy-aware software;adaptive security","","","","","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using the method of Protection Security Assessment (PSA), automatically evaluate the correct operation of protection devices in case of different fault scenarios. Three-phase and single-phase metallic faults are applied to validate protection system security. The PSA reassessed DER contribution and influence on protection selectivity. Adaptive rules should fix identified miss-coordinations by modifying protection settings or feeder automation logic. This paper applied adaptive rules to improve protection settings.

It is used to store, track, and analyze traffic that belongs to Virtual Networks (VNETs), Virtual Machines (VMs), or Network Interfaces (NICs). It is used for logging ingress and egress IP traffic flows, number of bytes and packets transmitted and received, and network connections. Flow logging is critical for the investigation of firewall functionalities, security incidents, and threat detection. Moreover, it can be used for detecting connection and network anomalies such as connection outages, configuration changes, or malicious activities. Alerts can be fired for any suspicious network activities. Visualization of flows logs provides insights such as who is using a web-service or an application, when customers are logged in and out, and what are the geographical locations where connections are being initiated or terminated. In this paper, a novel method for VNF that details the framework for logging network flows in a Cloud environment is provided. The method aims at accommodating multiple and simulations Cloud tenants and enabling the logging of network flows while at the same time accommodates high incoming rates of flow events and data. One of the major benefits of this new method is that it supports high number of flows per second that facilitates flow logging of high traffic volumes. Not only customers can experience higher number of flows logged, but the flow logs are visualized and contain the number of packets and bytes transmitted and received for outbound and inbound flows, respectively.","","978-1-5386-7693-6","10.1109/UEMCON.2018.8796641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8796641","Cloud;Distributed System;flow logging;virtualization;SDN;VNF","","cloud computing;computer network security;Internet;IP networks;network interfaces;telecommunication traffic;virtual machines;virtualisation","flow events;facilitates flow logging;high traffic volumes;flow logs;outbound;inbound;viewing;VNF;logging ingress;network connections;firewall functionalities;threat detection;detecting connection;connection outages;suspicious network activities;cloud environment;network analysis;virtualized network function;virtual networks;virtual machines;network interfaces;multiple simulations cloud tenants;advanced network flow logging;Microsoft azure distributed system","","1","","22","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A novel hybrid model is first founded to clearly explain the interactive hybrid behaviors of the power systems during significant disturbances. On the basis of the model, the hybrid control is proposed, which consists of upper level control strategies (including logic control commands for discrete events and energy management strategies) and lower level continuous controls for component units. The upper level control strategies are responsible for switching operating modes for the purpose of security operation following a significant disturbance, as well as power assignment for the economical efficiency of operation, and the lower level continuous controllers are responsible for regulating dynamic stability of the systems. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid control is demonstrated through simulation examples.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2012.2225046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6387633","Continuous controllers;energy management;hybrid control;logic control strategies;smart gird","Power system stability;Smart grids;Power system dynamics;Energy management","continuous systems;discrete event systems;energy management systems;hierarchical systems;power system control;power system economics;power system security;power system stability","two-level hierarchical hybrid control;smart power system;large power systems;security problems;stability problems;economical efficiency problems;component units;upper level control strategies;lower level continuous controllers;logic control commands;discrete event system;energy management strategies","","6","","24","IEEE","19 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Occasional incidents may cause overload problems, voltage problems, and cascading failures. These problems may damage the system stability. Therefore, in the normal state of the system, it is important to study the state transition and its harm to the system through security analysis. Besides, adopting certain control measures to reduce the risk of the system, such as the coordination of prevention and emergency control, is of great significance to both the safety and the economy of the system. In this premise, this paper proposes a risk-based two-layer optimization model for coordination on prevention control and emergency control of quasi-steady state AC-DC system. By introducing a continuous derivable function, the non-derivable constraints in the traditional model are replaced by continuous derivable constraints. The method can greatly improve the computational efficiency of the model. According to the characteristic of the two-layer optimization model, the first layer optimization problem is solved by the golden section method, and the second layer optimization problem is solved by the active and reactive power alternating approach method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with simulation example.","","978-1-5386-5392-0","10.1109/CIEEC.2018.8745954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8745954","AC-DC system;risk;coordination control;active and reactive power alternating approach method","Power system stability;Mathematical model;Optimization;Stability analysis;Power conversion;Reactive power","AC-DC power convertors;hybrid power systems;optimisation;power system control;power system security;power system stability;reactive power;risk analysis","risk-based two-layer optimization model;quasisteady state AC-DC hybrid system;cascading failures;voltage problems;overload problems;security analysis;continuous derivable function;golden section method;active and reactive power alternating approach method;system stability;emergency control;prevention control;risk-based coordination research","","","","15","IEEE","27 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This improves customers' energy security as they can reduce the intake of electricity from the power system within certain timeframes. Besides, this approach enables more efficient use of primary and secondary energy resources for better energy efficiency and conservation. An active power system (APS) may have a great variety of diverse operating conditions that effectively prevent any visual recognition and manual control of its operating modes; besides, they require automatic real-time process control. Such circumstances call for adjustments in the requirements to the structure of communication networks, metering and instrumentation systems, power system protections, monitoring and control systems. The algorithms that are used by phasor measurement units (PMU) and PMU-based smart devices (SD) to estimate current and voltage parameters are of fundamental importance. Active power systems are more demanding with respect to electric power quality and measurement accuracy. Calculations herein show the need to lower the allowable margin of voltage and current error in PMUs, as the existing requirements are not consistent with the functioning of active power systems.

Passwordless authentication is more convenient because the password now is removed and replaced with something you have, and it cannot be forgotten.

It thus promises broad application prospects in power generation. The whole generation system should operate in both stand-alone mode and grid-connected mode to provide uninterrupted and continuous power to critical loads. The two operating modes have different control structures due to separate control targets, increasing the control complexity of the power generator system. This paper proposes the control winding (CW) current-oriented vector control method for BDFIG in grid-connected mode, which has unique advantages in stand-alone mode. First, the modified variables are obtained under the CW-current rotating frame; Second, the power expression of the system is deduced according to the modified variables; Third, the angle of CW was chosen as a new control degree of freedom based on phase-angle control to realize power control. The proposed control strategy analyzed the control principle of CW-current amplitude and angle control in detail. This method adopts the same orientation strategy with stand-alone mode, which avoids the switching of orientation strategy in different operation modes, thus simplifying the system design a lot. Moreover, considering the same criteria GSC control, reactive power compensation, the control during grid voltage recovery and so on, the large CW-current can be limited at a safety level once the overload or grid faults happened, which can easily achieve Low-Voltage-Ride-Through (LVRT) and significantly increased security and stability of the system. Finally, the proposed control strategy is verified by the experimental results.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2023.3277820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10129920","Brushless doubly fed induction generator;CW-current-oriented;grid-connected operation;phase-angle control;power control","Power control;Windings;Rotors;Control systems;Reactive power;Doubly fed induction generators;Complexity theory","","","","","","","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In the field of AM security, sabotage attacks are cyberattacks that introduce inconspicuous defects to a manufactured component at any specific process of the AM digital process chain, resulting in the compromise of the component's structural integrity and load-bearing capabilities. Defense mechanisms that detect such attacks using side-channel analysis have been studied.

Unlike traditional crowd monitoring systems, which make use of simplex forms of different data types, data and information associated with crowded scenarios can be collected, fused, processed and analyzed in large quantities for accurate global assessment and enhanced decision making processes in an ICMMS. Therefore, data fusion is introduced as an enabler to decrease data quantity, reduce data dimensions, and improve data quality. In this paper, we first survey the literature on data fusion application in crowd monitoring systems as we are developing a state-of-the-art ICMMS with data fusion as a major platform enabler.

This method is further implemented by FPGA hardware, such that the performances of real-time and security of the control network are both guaranteed.

Our main technical innovation is based on a new ""two equation"" technique for revoking users. This technique results in two key contributions: First, our new scheme has ciphertext size overhead O(r), where r is the number of revoked users, and the size of public and private keys is only a constant number of group elements from an elliptic-curve group of prime order. In addition, the public key allows us to encrypt to an unbounded number of users. Our system is the first to achieve such parameters. We give two versions of our scheme: a simpler version which we prove to be selectively secure in the standard model under a new, but non-interactive assumption, and another version that employs the new dual system encryption technique of Waters to obtain adaptive security under the d-BDH and decisional Linear assumptions. Second, we show that our techniques can be used to realize Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) systems with nonmonotonic access formulas, where our key storage is significantly more efficient than previous solutions. This result is also proven selectively secure in the standard model under our new non-interactive assumption.","2375-1207","978-1-4244-6895-9","10.1109/SP.2010.23","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5504791","","Public key;Satellite broadcasting;Security;Public key cryptography;Elliptic curve cryptography;Wireless sensor networks;Privacy;Design methodology;Technological innovation;Equations","public key cryptography","revocation systems;small private keys;public key broadcast encryption systems;ciphertext size overhead;revoked users;elliptic curve group;adaptive security;d-BDH;decisional linear assumptions;attribute based encryption systems","","141","1","44","IEEE","8 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For these applications, security procedures are often omitted in the interest of performance. Since this may not be acceptable when using public communications media, our research makes explicit and then utilizes the inherent tradeoffs in realizing performance vs. security in communications. Toward this end, we expand the notion of QoS to include the level of security that can be offered within performance and CPU resource availability constraints. To address performance and security tradeoffs in asymmetric and dynamic client-server environments, we developed Authenticast, a dynamically configurable user-level communication protocol offering variable levels of security throughout the execution. Authenticast comprises multiple heuristics to realize dynamic security levels and to decide when and how to apply dynamic security. To demonstrate this protocol, we have implemented a prototype of a high-performance privacy system. This prototype offers a novel security control abstraction with which tradeoffs in security vs. performance may be made explicit and then utilized with dynamic client-server asymmetries. Authenticast uses the ""security thermostat"" to enable adaptive security processing. The results demonstrate increased scalability and improved performance when adaptive security is applied to the client-server platform with varying numbers of clients and varying resource availabilities at clients.","","0-7803-4482-0","10.1109/IWQOS.1998.675229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=675229","","Authentication;Communication system security;Information security;Availability;Protocols;Prototypes;Protection;Computer applications;Computer networks;Privacy","computer network management;message authentication;client-server systems;performance evaluation;electronic data interchange;telecommunication services;data privacy","dynamic authentication;high-performance networked computing applications;information exchange;information integrity;information protection;security procedures;public communications media;tradeoffs;service quality;CPU resource availability constraints;asymmetric dynamic client-server environments;Authenticast;dynamically configurable user-level communication protocol;multiple heuristics;dynamic security levels;high-performance privacy system;security control abstraction;security thermostat;adaptive security processing;scalability;resource availability","","19","14","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Threat modeling allows for a by-design approach, mitigating problems before they arise and avoiding later costly development efforts. However, it mainly pays off in software construction approaches that rely on planned architectures, in which sources of threats can be anticipated beforehand. These axiomatic assumptions are, however, increasingly untrue in contemporary software development practices in which software systems evolve drastically in later stages. In addition, software-intensive systems are increasingly faced with uncertainty in their operational contexts, and these are nearly impossible to enumerate in early development stages. In this article, we first present the idea of reflective threat modeling, which involves the automated derivation of architectural system models from run-time and operational system artifacts, providing the threat modeler with an accurate and workable run-time inspection view of the system. We then outline and motivate the potential of adopting threat analysis models as a basis for holistic and adaptive threat management through integration of adaptive security and privacy technologies.

As the first scheme to achieve the feature mentioned above, FABRIC not only enjoys constant computation overhead in the encryption, decryption, and re-encryption phases when the quantity of attributes increases, but is also unbounded such that the new attributes or roles could be adopted into the system anytime.

This omnipresence as well as the wireless nature of many embedded applications give rise to the need for sophisticated security and privacy preserving mechanisms. Trusted Computing is a promising new approach for computer security in which a system should be permanently in a well-defined and therefore trustworthy state. The adaption of such concepts for embedded systems with application specific requirements and limitations can provide promising security benefits. Besides, both in the industrial and academical sector a trend has become apparent to develop chips which include programmable cores as well as system reconfigurable components. Resultant chips will not be a single part of an embedded system anymore but rather can be used for the development of a whole system. Thus, FPGAs have become integral parts of embedded computing platforms. The reconfigurability of FPGAs offers major advantages when using them for cryptographic applications and it is suggested that an adaptive hardware-based trust anchor can greatly enhance the overall security level of an embedded system. In this paper we propose a concept of how such an adaptive security module could be designed as well as some possible fields of application.

With the development of large-scale generators and corresponding loss of field protection, the complicated structure leads to the high possibility of loss of field faults. According to the statistical data, more than sixty percentages of the synchronous generator faults are the excitation system faults, which might cause loss of load, tie-line tripping, instability, collapse and etc. Therefore, it is crucial to identify loss of field as early as possible and take countermeasures. In loss of field protection, the impedance boundary criterion of steady state stability limit is widely used to distinguish loss of field and normal condition. However, the steady state stability limit circle is affected by the system operating modes, which might result in mis-operation of the relay. In this paper, an approach for on-line identifying system equivalent impedance is presented based on PMU measurements. The steady state stability limit circle can be adaptively fit for operating modes.

Managing traditional desktop environments is incredibly challenging and costly. Tasks like installations, configuration changes, security measures require time-consuming procedures and dedicated deskside support. Also these distributed desktops are typically underutilized, resulting in low ROI for these assets. Further, this distributed computing model for desktops also creates a security concern as sensitive information could be compromised with stolen laptops or PCs. Desktop virtualization, which moves computation to the data center, allows users to access their applications and data using stateless ldquothin-clientldquo devices and therefore alleviates some of the problems of traditional desktop computing. Enterprises can now leverage the flexibility and cost-benefits of running users' desktops on virtual machines hosted at the data center to enhance business agility and reduce business risks, while lowering TCO. Recent research and development of cloud computing paradigm opens new possibilities of mass hosting of desktops and providing them as a service. However, transformation of legacy systems to desktop clouds as well as proper capacity provisioning is a challenging problem. Desktop cloud needs to be appropriately designed and provisioned to offer low response time and good working experience to desktop users while optimizing back-end resource usage and therefore minimizing provider's costs.

The goal of the SMM is to perform system management functions, such as hardware control and power management. Because of this, SMM has powerful resources. Moreover, its executive software executes unnoticed by any other component in the system, including operating systems and hypervisors. For that reason, SMM has been exploited in the past to facilitate attacks, misuse, or alternatively, building security tools capitalising on its resources. In this paper, we discuss how the use of the SMM has been contributing to the arms race between system's attackers and defenders. We analyse the main work published on attacks, misuse and implementing security tools in the SMM and how the SMM has been modified to respond to those issues. Finally, we discuss how Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology, a sort of ""hypervisor in processor"", presents a possible answer to the issue of using SMM for security purposes.","","978-1-4799-8937-9","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336375","SMM;security;PC architecture;virtualization;SGX","Security;Registers;Hardware;Operating systems;Virtual machine monitors;Process control","operating systems (computers);security of data;virtualisation","SMM;system management mode;processor operating mode;hardware control;power management;operating systems;hypervisors;system attackers;system defenders;Intel Software Guard Extensions technology;SGX technology;hypervisor","","","","37","IEEE","30 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The resulting violence or crime leads to terrible consequences. How to utilize reasonable means to predict the dangerous intentions of massive crowds and prevent the potential hazard to the public is significant for social security. A crowd monitoring and management system is an effective way to detect abnormal behavior. In this article, we release unmanned aerial vehicles as well as fixed ground devices to achieve multi-level and multi-modal behavioral sensing on a massive crowd, deploy a hybrid model in edge cloud to extract global features from behavioral data of a massive crowd, and then utilize these global features to construct decent classification algorithms for action recognition and behavioral semantic cognition. With the cooperation of behavioral data and cognitive algorithms, we can understand the instantaneous emotions of the crowd. On the basis of behavioral data and the emotional state of the crowd, the correlation between daily behavior and any dangerous intention of a massive crowd has been revealed by utilizing behavioral big data analysis, which is a key foundation for predicting people's dangerous intentions. Finally, we conduct a case study of abnormal behavior detection based on pix2pix and continuous video frames. The experimental results show that the performance of our method is better than other algorithms in both public datasets and the customized Hajj dataset. The proposed novel pattern for the effective learning of a massive crowd is validated to effectively eliminate some of the possible dangers caused by abnormal behavior.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.014.2000523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9829310","","Surveillance;Semantics;Big Data;Feature extraction;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Cognition;Stability analysis;Behavioral sciences;Sensors;Image edge detection;Prediction algorithms","autonomous aerial vehicles;behavioural sciences computing;Big Data;cloud computing;data analysis;emotion recognition;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);robot vision;video signal processing","social security;management system;massive crowd;global feature extraction;behavioral data;daily behavior;dangerous intention;behavioral big data analysis;abnormal behavior detection;crowd monitoring system;multilevel behavioral sensing;multimodal behavioral sensing;edge cloud;cognitive algorithms;abnormal behavior learning;edge computing;stability;crowd management system;classification algorithm;action recognition;dangerous intention prediction;unmanned aerial vehicles;behavioral semantic cognition;pix2pix;continuous video frames;customized Hajj dataset","","1","","15","IEEE","13 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The DACS scheme performs network management efficiently through the communication management of a client. As the characteristic of DACS scheme, only the setup modification is required by a system administrator, when configuration change of the network system is performed. Then, the setup modification is unnecessary by a customer, which shows a merit for both a system administrator and a customer. However, there is a problem to be solved. In existing DACS scheme, it is promised that, DACS client for controlling the communication must be implemented on all clients. When the client not installing DACS client is connected to the network, each network server can be accessed from the client.

However, identification of suitable locations, where the effect of these FACTs devices will be most beneficial to the network, has been a growing concern to electric power utilities in planning and operation of power systems. Consequently, a safe and reliable power system operation requires that all operating states, which could be used to enhance power system operation such as voltage profile enhancement and loss reduction, must be quickly detected and identified. This paper, therefore, introduces a Line Strength Index (LSI) for identifying suitable locations where reactive power supports such as Thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) could be located for voltage profile enhancement and transmission loss reduction within the system. Furthermore, the influence of TCSC placement on the voltage profile and transmission losses is investigated. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a simple 6-bus power network. The results obtained are compared with that obtained when TCSC is placed at a randomly selected location. This shows that the integrity of a stressed power network, in terms of security and reliability, could be easily enhanced through the application of TCSC whose placement is determined by LSI, a non-iterative-based approach.","","978-1-5386-7709-4","10.1109/CTEMS.2018.8769127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8769127","voltage profile;transmission loss;thyristor-controlled series capacitor;coupling strength matrix;line strength index","Thyristors;Power capacitors;Reactive power;Large scale integration;Power transmission lines;Propagation losses","electricity supply industry;flexible AC transmission systems;power capacitors;power system security;power transmission planning;power transmission reliability;reactive power;thyristors","voltage profile enhancement;transmission loss reduction;TCSC placement;identifying suitable locations;reactive power;electric power utilities;operating states;power system operation;FACT devices;power system planning;LSI;thyristor-controlled series capacitor;system reliability;line strength index;noniterative-based approach;system security;6-bus power network operation","","1","","21","IEEE","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Surveys were distributed to workers in the hospital who require access to patient records - such as clinicians and administrators. The survey resulted in an 86% response rate. The results revealed key problem areas which related to a lack of user awareness and acceptance. One of the key problems was that 79% of respondents indicated they have never had any security awareness sessions or training. Insights from the survey were used to create a framework. The framework extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance of User Technology (UTAUT) model, to address awareness and acceptance problems.

In this connection, several novel approaches for assessing vulnerability and improving security in real time have been developed. However, most of the work is commonly focused on tackling stability phenomena, while the possible overloads are often treated as negligible in real-time power system security. But sometimes, high electric post-contingency currents might provoke overloads which could increase the system security problem. This paper tackles the possible overload issues by applying a novel adaptive load shedding (ALS) method. First, the possibility of fast post-contingency overloads is evaluated using Statistical Distribution Factors (SDFs) that allow computing an Overload Index (OVI) in real time. The results are then used for triggering an adequate ALS scheme that allows improving the system security level when the OVI reaches a critical value. For this purpose, Monte Carlo-based contingency analysis is firstly performed to iteratively calculate ac Distribution Factors (ac-DFs). After, SDFs are defined by the mean of ac-DFs. These SDFs are then used together with principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine classifier (SVM-C) in order to structure a table-based real-time post-contingency overload estimation algorithm, which allow computing OVIs depending on the actual operating state and the type of contingency. In the cases where OVI reaches inadmissible levels, an ALS scheme is triggered using a centralized strategy. The aim is to alleviate the current in overloaded transmission lines before the local overload protection acts, since it might initiate a cascading event that would eventually drive the system to a blackout. The proposal is structured to act in coordination with the traditional underfrequency and undervoltage load shedding. For this purpose, PMU measurements of voltage phasors and frequency are used for evaluating the event evolution in order to determine the adequate amount of load to be shed due to overload problems. The scheme also determines the location of the load to be shed by analyzing the participation of each load in the overloaded line via the computation of electrical distances between the overloaded-line receiving-end bus and the load bus. The proposal is tested on the IEEE New England 39-bus test system. Results show the feasibility of the methodology in alerting about possible overloads and defining an appropriate ALS scheme that allows alleviating the current in the possible overloaded lines.","","978-1-4799-6251-8","10.1109/TDC-LA.2014.6955190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6955190","Monte Carlo;overload;principal component analysis;security;smart grid;support vector machine;vulnerability assessment;adaptive load shedding‥","Load flow;Real-time systems;Estimation;Indexes;Security;Power system stability;Principal component analysis","load shedding;Monte Carlo methods;phasor measurement;power system security;power transmission lines;principal component analysis;support vector machines","event evolution;electrical distances;overloaded-line receiving-end bus;load bus;IEEE New England 39-bus test system;voltage phasors;PMU measurements;cascading event;overloaded transmission lines;table-based real-time post-contingency overload estimation algorithm;SVM-C;support vector machine classifier;PCA;principal component analysis;ac-DF;ac distribution factors;Monte Carlo-based contingency analysis;system security level;OVI;overload index;SDFs;statistical distribution factors;fast post-contingency overloads;ALS method;adaptive load shedding method;overload issues;high electric post-contingency currents;real-time power system security;stability phenomena","","4","","11","IEEE","13 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our analysis shows that it is possible to extract this information, essential for security monitoring, purely from the raw network traffic and without background knowledge provided by the control system engineers.

Temporal diversity can be achieved by making periodic configuration changes; however in an infrastructure of multiple similarly purposed computers diversity must also be spatial, ensuring multiple computers do not simultaneously share the same configuration and potential vulnerabilities. Given the number of possible changes and their potential interdependencies discovering computer configurations that are secure, functional, and diverse is challenging. This paper describes how a Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be employed to find temporally and spatially diverse secure computer configurations. In the proposed approach a computer configuration is modeled as a chromosome, where an individual configuration setting is a trait or allele. The GA operates by combining multiple chromosomes (configurations) which are tested for feasibility and ranked based on performance which will be measured as resistance to attack. Successive iterations of the GA yield configurations that are often more secure and diverse due to the crossover and mutation processes. Simulations results will demonstrate this approach can provide at MT environment for a large infrastructure of similarly purposed computers by discovering temporally and spatially diverse secure configurations.","","978-1-4673-0402-3","10.1109/SafeConfig.2011.6111663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6111663","","Computers;Biological cells;Security;Genetic algorithms;Computational modeling;Hamming distance;Diversity reception","configuration management;genetic algorithms;security of data","moving target environment;genetic algorithms;computer systems;security;temporal diversity;periodic configuration changes;secure computer configurations","","16","1","12","IEEE","26 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Magnetic field sensors are important for building automated functions in production lines, intelligent transportation systems, security systems and so on. The orthogonal fluxgate mechanism provides miniaturized low-cost magnetic sensors which can be incorporated in a compact electronic systems. The author proposed a new operating mode, fundamental mode, for the orthogonal fluxgate in which greater linear response and higher sensitivity can be obtained with an as-cast amorphous wire core compared to the conventional orthogonal fluxgate mechanism where the second harmonic is a measure of applied magnetic field. When the magnetic anisotropy is present, however, in an amorphous wire at off circumferential direction, the offset may arise and the input-output response curve becomes asymmetric with respect to the origin.

"The importance of trust in a Layered Sensing construct","M. Nowak","Autonomic Trusted Sensing of Persistent Intelligence Division, Air Force Research Laboratory, Dayton, OH, USA","2010 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems","3 Jun 2010","2010","","","555","556","The technological advances of the information age have created both an opportunity and a challenge for military decision makers. At first glance, the variety of data gathered by a multitude of traditional and non-traditional Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors should allow decision makers to better understand their environment and the threat. However, a number of factors tend to erode this advantage. Incompatible data formats, bandwidth limitations, sensor persistence and revisit rates, and multi-level security issues are but a few of the technical challenges that preclude end users from being able to take full advantage of the sensor information. Further, as the amount of sensor data increases, real challenges emerge in identifying the most salient pieces of information, fusing that with other relevant sensor modalities, and rapidly moving this information in a presentation format that does not overwhelm the decision maker. It was this problem space of improving information understanding to increase the situational awareness of decision makers that spawned the Layered Sensing vision. Layered Sensing has grown from an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate initiative into an AFRL effort that seeks to bring fused, multi-source, multi-spectral, multi-dimensional (e.g. cultural, environmental, etc.) information to decision makers consistent with their needs, regardless of their location. The end goal of Layered Sensing is to improve the situational awareness of decision makers by providing them with tailored sensor information. In essence, Layered Sensing is a Sensing Oriented Architecture where the customer can provide or request information tailored to their needs in order to facilitate situational awareness. The benefits of Layered Sensing extend beyond military application. For example, the Department of Homeland Security is one federal agency that could potentially face many of the same information challenge in operations as diverse as providing a common operating picture during a post-Katrina type reconstitution scenario or in fusing multi-source and multi-mode data (e.g. HUMINT, electronic intercepts, etc) in order to track or capture a suspected terrorist. Regardless of who implements a Layered Sensing architecture, the critical attribute of “trust” will have to be addressed - trusted information, trusted communication and trusted sensors. Trust is the sine qua non for any Layered Sensing implementation as it is difficult, if not impossible, to build situational awareness upon inaccurate, misleading, or maliciously modified information. The challenge of instilling and measuring trust in a system has many components. At the sensor node the issue of trust is one of ensuring the sensor works as intended and has not been compromised or co-opted. Between sensors, communications paths must be reliable, secure, and robust enough to recover from equipment degradation or malfunctions. Ideally, the local and global architecture should be autonomic with the ability to optimize sensor and communication performance. Finally, there needs to be a means to measure and portray the overall architecture trust picture status to those who are using it. The use of commercial off-the-shelf equipment, while cost effective, introduces its own trust issues due to uncontrollable supply chains. Relying solely on components from trusted sources is not feasible either economically or practically. As Layered Sensing moves from local architectures supporting an urban scenario to a global scenario the issue of complexity will arise. Seamlessly integrating a large number of spatially and temporally distributed heterogeneous sensors will require effective means to authenticate the new arrivals. Dynamic bandwidth allocation to account for optimal data transmission will also be important. Encompassing all of these trust issues is a way to measure and portray a “trust picture” to users. Instinctively, decision makers weigh the accuracy of data they receive based on their experiences with those data sources. For example, live-feed imagery will likely carry more weight in forming the user's situational awareness of a battle space rather than dated intelligence reports or HUMINT. For sensor derived information, the measure of trust of data is a function of the sensor, the environment it's operating in, the networks transmitting that data, and the fusion engine used to correlate the information. It's important these metrics of trust be available to the decision maker particularly if he/she is predisposed to rely on certain sensors/information sources over others. This conference represents the third time papers and studies have been presented that address the challenges associated with Layered Sensing.

"Counting clicks and beeps: Exploring numerosity based haptic and audio PIN entry","A. Bianchi; I. Oakley; D. S. Kwon",NA; NA; NA,"Interacting with Computers","18 Jan 2018","2012","24","5","409","422","Haptic and audio cues now appear commonly in computer interfaces, partially due to inherent advantages such as their support for eyes-free interaction. Their invisible, unobservable nature also makes them ideal candidates for security interfaces in which users have to enter secret information such as passwords. In particular, researchers have explored this idea through the design of PIN entry authentication systems based on multi-modal combinations of visual and non-visual content or on the recognition of small sets of unimodal haptic or audio stimuli. This paper highlights the benefits and performance limitations of these approaches and introduces an alternative based on unimodal audio or haptic temporal numerosity – the ability to accurately and rapidly determine the number of cues presented in rapid temporal succession. In essence, in a numerosity interface, rather than recognizing distinct cues, users must count the number of times that a single cue occurs. In an iterative process of design and evaluation, three prototypes implementing this concept are presented and studies of their use reported. The results show the fastest PIN entry times and lowest error rates to be 8 s and 2%, figures that improve substantially on previous research. These results are attained while maintaining low levels of workload and substantial resistance to observation attack (as determined via camera attack security studies). In sum, this paper argues that unimodal audio and haptic numerosity is a valuable and relatively unexplored metaphor for non-visual input and demonstrates the validity of this claim in the demanding task of unobservable authentication systems.","1873-7951","","10.1016/j.intcom.2012.06.005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8147050","Human factors;Haptics and audio;Authentication;Mobile","","","","","13","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In such an environment, the research on network security gradually develops and presents a thriving development trend. The purpose of this paper is to design and develop an abnormal access recognition platform for network information based on the background of multimodal data flow. Firstly, according to the characteristics of information in the network security management system, the multi-source multi-modal data analysis algorithm is selected as the abnormal traffic detection method. Next, the system design is carried out, the data acquisition module uses tcpdump to realize the acquisition of information data in the network. Anomaly detection module adopts multi-source and multi-modal data analysis algorithm to complete anomaly identification. Finally, the practicability and detection ability of the system are evaluated, that is, it is compared and analyzed with big data technology and BP neural network model. 50 experiments were carried out for each algorithm. The test results show that the detection rate of abnormal access recognition of network information designed in this paper is 94.25% and the accuracy rate is 93.09%, which are higher than the other two models, with a false detection rate of 4.29% and a missed detection rate of 2.49%, which are lower than the other two models. Therefore, compared with big data technology and BP neural network model, the multi-source multi-modal data analysis algorithm designed in this paper has better performance in identifying abnormal access to network information.","","978-1-6654-6290-7","10.1109/ICWCAPP57292.2022.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148508","Multimodal Data Flow;Network Information;Abnormal Access Identification;Platform Development","Analytical models;Data analysis;Processor scheduling;Neural networks;Network security;Big Data;Dynamic scheduling","backpropagation;Big Data;computer network security;data acquisition;data analysis;Internet;neural nets;telecommunication traffic","abnormal access identification;abnormal access recognition platform;abnormal traffic detection method;anomaly detection module;Big Data technology;BP neural network model;data acquisition module;information data;multimodal data flow;multisource multimodal data analysis algorithm;network information;network security issues;network security management system","","","","17","IEEE","14 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to offer person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones. And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal systems) or multiple traits (Bi- or Multi-modal systems). The latter is applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric and its application. The above mentioned challenges will be analyzed deeply. The suitability of each biometric sensor according to the aimed application will be deeply discussed.

Security is important in data protection so as not to be infringed by unauthorized parties. If the vulnerabilities found are not amended, it leads to cyber-attacks such as Structured Query Language Injection Attack (SQLIA) performed by certain parties which enable them to gain unauthorized data access. To cater security issues, variety of security frameworks for secure software development life cycle (SDLC) were introduced. Secure SDLC is created by integrating security-related activities to an each phase of in used development methodologies such as waterfall model or agile model. However, the application security problem continues to grow. Strict, complicated and heavyweight frameworks are underutilized due to several factors. The factors that influence the implementation of secure SDLC identified in public sector (the scope is State Secretary Offices in Malaysia) are inadequate development timeline, improper development team size and less awareness of team members' workload. It is agreed that integrating security at earlier (requirement and design) phase is the most effective and cheapest way to develop secure web application. Hence, an adaptive secure SDLC model is proposed to integrate security activities using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) focusing on the influence factors as the main criteria and meet the international and local secure frameworks standards. The proposed model will recommend adaptive security activities as a guideline to be applied at earlier phases of SDLC to help eliminate/ minimize the web application vulnerabilities and increase the application security and implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype at selected Malaysian public sector for in-house web application development.","","978-1-5386-6925-9","10.1109/AINS.2018.8631401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8631401","web application;security activities;secure SDLC;in-house web application development;public sector","Security;Software;NIST;Information technology;Testing","analytic hierarchy process;data protection;fuzzy set theory;Internet;security of data;software engineering;SQL","structured query language injection attack;software development life cycle;Malaysian public sector;SQLIA;waterfall model;FAHP;fuzzy analytic hierarchy process;agile model;health organizations;financial organizations;in-house web application development;local secure frameworks standards;international frameworks standards;adaptive secure SDLC model;unauthorized data access;cyber-attacks;data protection","","","","46","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments. Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM, designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and waiver-granted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADS-B, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network. Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and non-compliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS. The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we will present our experimental design and current test data from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM, and GA shared airspace research.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-0649-6","10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9081710","fail-safe;fail-secure;UAS;UTM;UAM;GPS;ADS-B","","aerospace computing;air traffic control;aircraft navigation;autonomous aerial vehicles;cloud computing;control engineering computing;data mining;Global Positioning System;inertial navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;sensor fusion","inertial navigation systems;security threats;safe sUAS-UAM shared airspace;secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace;passive visual sensor nodes;acoustic sensor nodes;air traffic control;acoustic arrays;urban UAS operating region;Class-D airspace;Drone Net approach;ground radar;Drone Net network;fail-secure property;ground sensor network;ground-system sensor fusion;UTM flight plan;fail-secure methods;multiple UAS;regional cloud-based networks;multisensor drone detection;Drone Net project;global cloud-based networks;UAS traffic management network;fail-safe experiments;ADS-B;GPS;Global Positioning System;UAM airspace;UAM vehicles;heterogeneous drone shapes;innovative aviation designs;air taxi service;urban air mobility;unmanned aerial systems;urban airspace;UAM traffic;fail-secure experiments;flight instruments;airspace safety;flight sensor network","","7","","43","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a real-time counterpart of a physical world. DT offers significant advantages to cybersecurity experts, empowering them to predict risks without entering the physical world, and to simulate and test cyber-attacks that would otherwise be infeasible to do in real-time in the physical environment. DT in healthcare helps to identify security vulnerabilities, conduct attack simulations, and potential security breaches by creating a virtual replica of the targeted healthcare systems.

Such devices will however be broadly used only if they are ""prescribed"" by the hospitals as a part of a therapy and are reimbursed by the insurances. For this we need the proof of their safety, medical efficacy and economic efficiency. Aside of obligatory clinical trials we need an extensive system of post-market surveillance, because: a medical device is a part of a complex cyber-physical system, with humans in the loop / the environment cannot be sufficiently defined / humans react differently to the therapy, they also behave differently / after every software upgrade the device is not the same as before In their operation such devices generate huge amounts of data that can be reused for such analysis. Technically oriented people believe it can be done using a Big Data Analytics system without a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. It is doubtful if such approach can deliver useful results. The main problems seem to be: unbalanced cohort / various patient groups with various preferences / multiple quality parameters (basic algorithm, signal propagation, battery, security & privacy, obtrusiveness, etc.) / multiple variants (operating modes, device settings) / variability of the device and of the environment. When we transform data into ""actionable knowledge"", especially if the generated decisions influence human health, utmost care has to be applied. The goal of this paper is to present the complexity of the problem, warn against hasty, purely technical solutions, raise interest among specialists in health statistics and ignite an interdisciplinary cooperation to solve it.","","978-1-4673-9473-4","10.1109/3PGCIC.2015.96","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424592","Smart Medical Devices;Medical Statistics;Evidence Based Medicine","Software;Biomedical imaging;Hospitals;Biomedical monitoring;Smart phones;Monitoring;Batteries","Big Data;computational complexity;cyber-physical systems;data analysis;medical computing;socio-economic effects;statistical analysis","statistical challenges;quality assessment;smart medical devices;connected medicine;disruptive trend;health care;hospitals;insurances;medical efficacy;economic efficiency;obligatory clinical trials;post-market surveillance;complex cyber-physical system;software upgrade;technically oriented people;big data analytics system;unbalanced cohort;patient groups;multiple quality parameters;device variability;actionable knowledge;human health;problem complexity;health statistics","","2","","28","IEEE","3 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since most of the biometric systems only use one modality, it may cause issues such as noise in sensed data, intra-class differences, and similarities between classes, etc. In order to avoid some problems i.e., universality and security purposes multi-modal biometrics are proposed in this work. Multi-modal biometrics uses more than one modality for recognition. Various fusion techniques, including feature level, score level, decision level, etc., will be used to carry out these biometric recognition systems. In this study, we will put into practice a multi-modal biometric face and fingerprint identification system employing feature level fusion. The stages involved in building this system are, firstly it details the preprocessing techniques for both face and fingerprint and then the VGG16 model is built to carry out the further process i.e., extracting the individual features and then the individual model's features are classified using the support vector classifier SVC and got the accuracy of 90% for face and 93% for fingerprint. Next to do the fusion individual features are combined together using concatenation technique. Finally, the combined features are classified using the same classifier which is used for individual models and got the fused accuracy as 97%. This experimental result is carried out on the (Chinese academy of science’s institute of automation) CASIAFaceV5 and CASIA-FingerprintV5 datasets.","","979-8-3503-4805-7","10.1109/ICAECIS58353.2023.10170487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10170487","Multi-modal biometrics;Feature fusion;Face;Fingerprint;CASIA dataset;security;vgg16","Face recognition;Biological system modeling;Support vector machine classification;Static VAr compensators;Fingerprint recognition;Feature extraction;Physiology","biometrics (access control);face recognition;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;image fusion;neural nets;support vector machines","behavioral traits;biometric authentication systems;biometric recognition systems;biometric systems;CASIA-FingerprintV5 dataset;CASIAFaceV5 dataset;Chinese Academy of Science Institute of Automation;decision level;feature level fusion;fingerprint biometric traits;fingerprint identification system;fusion techniques;intra-class differences;multimodal biometric face;multimodal biometrics;physiological traits;score level;support vector classifier;SVC;VGG16 model","","","","14","IEEE","7 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applications such as personal identification, access control, forensics applications, e-banking, e-government, e-health and recently personalized human-smart-home and human-robot interaction present some examples. In order to offer person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones. And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal systems) or multiple traits (Bi-or Multi-modal systems). The latter is applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric and its application. The above mentioned challenges will be analyzed deeply. The suitability of each biometric sensor according to the aimed application will be deeply discussed. Detailed comparison between uni-modal and Multi-modal biometric system will present which system where to be utilized. Privacy and security issues of biometric systems will be discussed too. Three scenarios of biometric application in home-environment, human-robot-interaction and e-health will be presented.","","978-1-4673-6636-6","10.1109/WCITCA.2015.7367059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7367059","","Biomedical imaging;Biometrics (access control);Feature extraction;Biosensors;Reliability;Veins","biometrics (access control);data privacy;health care;home computing;human-robot interaction;security of data","biometric system;biometric sensor;home environment;human-robot-interaction;e-health;privacy application;security application","","","","9","IEEE","4 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it becomes imperative to guarantee for all GNSS users the compatibility, interoperability and interchangeability between all these systems. The goal is to ensure that the user's multi-mode receiver can choose and mix signals from different GNSS and SBAS systems to achieve more availability, accuracy and robustness. Attaining that objective will require agreements on frequency plans and signal designs, as well as other details including means to ensure interoperability of system times and geodetic reference systems. This paper suggests a Universal-SBAS (U-SBAS) standard, compatible with all the existing and planned regional GNSS systems (and their evolutions) in the world, like IRNSS, QZSS, PCW, BEIDOU-1, WAAS, EGNOS, SDCM, GAGAN, MSAS.

The proposed framework has four operating modes to run according to user needs of system performance and wireless security. Therefore, the framework provides much more flexibility in employing a variety of security protocols, and performance-security trade-offs.

Due to the lack of scientific understanding of the basic laws of safety risks, personal accidents are repeatedly happened, leading to vicious electric shock accidents. In addition, if faults cannot be handled quickly and in a timely manner, ground faults can easily cause device overvoltage, causing equipment burnout and even causing fire accidents. Single phase grounding fault and power failure will reduce the reliability of power supply and directly affect industrial production and people's living standards. This article is mainly based on the international advanced safety management concept. By identifying the influencing factors of single-phase grounding in distribution networks and closely integrated with power grid enterprises actual field operations, using the “5M safety risk factor” theory to analyze the personal safety and equipment safety influencing factors in power supply operations, extract six major influence factors that have a greater impact on the distribution network operation and personal safety. Based on the above points, a quantitative assessment model, index, and method system for single-phase fault processing based on security protection are proposed to effectively improve the person and device safety in power grid companies.

Because of the rise of battery or even field-supplied systems these mechanisms often heavily decrease available power budgets or lead to significantly increased production costs. Therefore, this paper introduces novel micro-architectural execution signature characterization and handling techniques for system-on-chip designs providing power estimation hardware. Existing power sensor infrastructure is reused to enable efficient system-state monitoring using micro-architectural hashes to cover a wide range of implemented system functionality.

Owing to its adaptive nature in delivering a dynamic rule base, it is particularly useful for those systems which experience frequent changes. Network security is one such area where frequent changes are quite likely due to changing network conditions and traffic. Thus, D-FRI has the potential to offer an optimised and adaptive approach for improving network security. The popular Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Firewall is capable of monitoring and alerting a range of common threats, by baselining the traffic of a network and analysing the statistics of dropped packets. An ASA process yields a large volume of statistical information relating to certain security events. Yet, threat detection is a rudimentary function since additional intelligence is required to automate the extraction of meaningful information for alerting the users. This could be achieved using expensive automated tools offered by a third party, but doing so may unnecessarily expose an organisation to other security threats. This paper takes a different approach, presenting a DFRI-CiscoFirewall in support of automated threat detection for Cisco ASA Firewall. Through utilising threat detection statistics, the approach can customise the detection process according to organisational requirements. It performs the relative analysis of prioritised security events and is able to predict comprehensive security situations while no matching rules are available. In particular, the approach supports the creation of a dynamic rule base, derived from changing network conditions and traffic density. Its efficacy is demonstrated by experimental evaluations.","1558-4739","978-1-5386-1728-1","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2019.8858999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8858999","","Firewalls (computing);Interpolation;Fuzzy logic;Monitoring;Access control;Communication networks","computer network management;firewalls;fuzzy reasoning;interpolation;knowledge based systems;security of data","dynamic fuzzy rule interpolation;Cisco ASA Firewall;sparse rule-based fuzzy reasoning;dynamic rules;dynamic rule base;network security;optimised approach;adaptive approach;security threats;automated threat detection;threat detection statistics;prioritised security events;comprehensive security situations;matching rules;D-FRI-CiscoFirewall;Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Firewall","","5","","19","Crown","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, a Hand vein and Iris based multimodal Fingerprint system is designed with Deep Learning. Encrypting the alignment maintaining characteristics, the hand vein based method aims to be more robustly tolerant of the possible fractures, rotating, and translational shifts. As a step towards Palm Vein Identification, a picture processing method is used to examine the vascular pattern of the hand palm vein. Iris biometrics were integrated into the authentication process to further strengthen its reliability.

The zone controllers (ZC), which is formulated by deep neural networks (DNN), then communicate with their neighbors and track the optimal total reactive power support of PVs in each zone. In the offline training process, an analytical derivation to minimize power losses is also provided that can help the input and output selection of DNN. To online dispatch reactive power for individual utility-scale and customer-owned PVs in corresponding zones, a multi-mode reactive power allocation strategy is proposed. Three different modes namely loss reduction mode (LRM), fair power sharing mode (FPM) and voltage security mode (VSM) are designed to meet varying operation requirements, which can mitigate voltage violations with fair participation for customers and reduced power losses for system operators. Numerical simulations are performed on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding a trade-off between voltage security and loss minimization with fairness.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2022.3213587","ARC Research Hub(grant numbers:IH180100020); ARC Training Centre(grant numbers:IC200100023); ARC Linkage Project(grant numbers:LP200100056); ARC(grant numbers:DP220103881); Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Key Program)(grant numbers:71931003,72061147004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72171206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9916057","Combined central and distributed;deep neural networks;multi-mode reactive power allocation;Volt/Var control;customer-owned PVs","Voltage control;Reactive power;Optimization;Capacitors;Voltage measurement;Training;Security","deep learning (artificial intelligence);load flow control;load forecasting;numerical analysis;on load tap changers;photovoltaic power systems;power distribution control;power engineering computing;power generation control;power generation dispatch;power grids;power system security;reactive power control;voltage control","active distribution networks;ADN;capacitor banks;central controller;customer-owned photovoltaic system;day-ahead PV;deep neural networks;dispatch reactive power;DNN;IEEE 33-bus distribution system;load predictions;load types;loss minimization;loss reduction mode;multimode reactive power allocation strategy;numerical simulations;offline training process;on-load tap changers;optimal power flow;optimal total reactive power support;power losses;power sharing mode;system operators;two-stage combined central and distributed Volt-Var control strategy;utility-scale;voltage regulation;voltage security;voltage security mode;voltage violations;zone controllers","","","","33","IEEE","11 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this connection, several novel approaches for assessing vulnerability in real time have been developed. However, most of the work is commonly focused on tackling stability phenomena, while the possible overloads are often treated as negligible in real-time power system security. But sometimes, high electric post-contingency currents might provoke overloads which could increase the system vulnerability problem. This paper presents a novel method for assessing the possibility of fast post-contingency overloads using Statistical Distribution Factors (SDFs) that allow computing an Overload Index (OVI) in real time. First, Monte Carlo-based contingency analysis is performed to iteratively calculate ac Distribution Factors (ac-DFs). After, SDFs are defined by the mean and standard deviation of ac-DFs. These SDFs are then used together with principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine classifier (SVM-C) in order to structure a table-based real-time post-contingency overload estimation algorithm, which allow computing OVIs depending on the actual operating state and the type of contingency. The proposal is tested on the IEEE New England 39-bus test system. Results show the feasibility of the methodology in alerting about fast possible overloads.","","978-1-4673-2673-5","10.1109/TDC-LA.2012.6319111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6319111","Monte Carlo;overload;principal component analysis;security;smart grid;support vector machine;vulnerability assessment","Power system stability;Real-time systems;Load flow;Thermal stability;Stability analysis;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines","Monte Carlo methods;pattern classification;power engineering computing;power system planning;power system reliability;power system security;power system stability;principal component analysis;real-time systems;smart power grids;statistical distributions;support vector machines","probabilistic-based overload estimation;real-time smart grid vulnerability assessment;power system control;power system protection;power system monitoring;stability;real-time power system security;high electric post-contingency currents;power system vulnerability problem;fast post-contingency overloads;statistical distribution factors;SDF;overload index;OVI;Monte Carlo-based contingency analysis;iterative calculation;ac distribution factors;ac-DF;principal component analysis;PCA;support vector machine classifier;SVM-C;table-based real-time post-contingency overload estimation algorithm;IEEE New England 39-bus test system","","8","","34","IEEE","4 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The VOW constructs a dynamic vibration tensor which presents the operating state of air compressors according to the real time vibration data, strengthens the association among the monitoring data in spatial domain and time domain. Thus, dynamic characteristic, which reflects the fault information, can be contained in the dynamic vibration tensor explicitly. For proving the advantage of VOW method, we compare the performance between the fault diagnosis system with VOW and the fault diagnosis system without VOW based on different hardware environments: embedded computer, and high speed Industrial PC.

Inspired by resilient ecosystems, this paper presents a resilient network design approach with an ecological robustness (RECO)-oriented optimization to improve power systems' ability to maintain a secure operating state throughout unknown hazards. The approach uses RECO, a surprisal-based metric that captures key features of an ecosystem's resilient structure, as an objective to strategically design the electrical network. The approach enables solvability and practicality by introducing a stochastic-based candidate branch creation algorithm and a Taylor series expansion for relaxation of the RECO formulation. Finally, studies are conducted on the RECO-oriented approach using the IEEE 24 Bus RTS and the ACTIVSg200 systems. Results demonstrate improvement of the system's reliability under multiple hazards, network properties of robust structure and equally distributed power flows, and survivability against cascading failures. From the analysis, we observe that a more redundant network structure with equally distributed power flows benefits its resilience.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3262501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10083292","Power Networks Design;Ecological Robustness;Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming;Power System Reliability;Power System Resilience","Resilience;Power systems;Ecosystems;Hazards;Robustness;Planning;Contingency management","","","","","","","CCBY","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The optimization problem is formulated to schedule the system operation in both normal and islanding modes by addressing the prevailing uncertainties of islanding duration as well as prediction errors of loads, renewable power generation, and electricity price. In a normal operation mode, where the grid-connection is available, the energy and reserve of local resources and energy trading with the main grid is scheduled to maximize the operator's profit considering feasible islanding. In a resilient operating mode, which is triggered by a disturbance in the main grid, the local resources should be scheduled to supply loads with the lowest emergency load shedding. To balance the economy and security requirements under uncertainties, the optimal scheduling is done properly through a security-constrained power flow method by considering system's objectives and constraints. Moreover, to properly handle the uncertainties of the problem, conditional value-at-risk metric is incorporated with the optimization model to control the risk of profit variability. The proposed scheme is implemented on a test microgrid and various case studies are presented to verify its effectiveness in normal and resiliency operating conditions.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.3026142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229142","Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR);demand response;optimal scheduling;resilient microgrid;stochastic framework","Microgrids;Uncertainty;Optimal scheduling;Stochastic processes;Islanding;Load modeling;Indexes","demand side management;distributed power generation;load flow;load shedding;optimisation;power distribution economics;power distribution faults;power generation economics;power generation scheduling;power grids;power markets;power system security;pricing;stochastic processes","islanding modes;renewable power generation;electricity price;operation mode;grid-connection;local resources;energy trading;resilient operating mode;optimal scheduling;security-constrained power flow method;conditional value-at-risk metric;optimization model;risk-based stochastic scheduling;resilient microgrids;demand response programs;risk-constrained stochastic framework;load shedding;resiliency operating conditions","","27","","31","IEEE","19 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This requires an adaptation quality metric that captures (1) an application's susceptibility to cyber attacks and (2) an application's functionality, since adapting an application affects both of these factors. FUZZBUSTER uses different types of test cases to measure security and functionality. In this paper, we describe FUZZBUSTER's adaptation metrics and we present two different policies for balancing security and functionality.

Almost all disciplines of science and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data in some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security surveillance. Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-time broadcast of unfolding events on social networks. Multimedia data is not just big in volume, but also multi-modal and mostly unstructured. Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, and recognizing from the vast amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. Even though significant progress has been made processing multimedia data, today's solutions are inadequate in handling data from millions of sources simultaneously.

In this work, an open-loop interrogation strategy is proposed to use radio-frequency acoustic transducers as micro-balances for that purpose. The resulting system is dedicated to the monitoring of chemical compounds in gaseous or liquid-phase state. A 16 Hz standard deviation is demonstrated at 125 MHz, with a working frequency band in the 60 to 133 MHz range, answering the requirements for using Rayleigh- and Love-wave-based delay lines operating with 40-μm acoustic wavelength transducers. Moreover, this electronic setup was used to interrogate a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR) microbalance, a new sensor class allowing for multi-mode interrogation for gravimetric measurement improvement. The noise source still limiting the system performance is due to the analog-to-digital converter of the microcontroller, thus leaving open degrees-of-freedom for improving the obtained results by optimizing the voltage reference and board layout. The operation of the system is illustrated using a calibrated galvanic deposition at the surface of Love-wave delay lines to assess theoretical predictions of their gravimetric sensitivity and to compare them with HBAR-based sensor sensitivity.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6521071","","","acoustic transducers;analogue-digital conversion;bulk acoustic wave devices;gravimeters;Love waves;microbalances;Rayleigh waves","high-sensitivity open-loop electronics;gravimetric acoustic-wave-based sensor;chemical species detection;gas phase;security control;open-loop interrogation strategy;radio-frequency acoustic transducer;chemical compound monitoring;gaseous phase state;liquid-phase state;standard deviation;Rayleigh-wave-based delay lines;Love-wave-based delay lines;acoustic wavelength transducer;high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator microbalance;HBAR microbalance;sensor class;multimode interrogation;gravimetric measurement improvement;noise source;system performance;analog-to-digital converter;microcontroller;voltage reference;board layout;calibrated galvanic deposition;gravimetric sensitivity;HBAR-based sensor sensitivity;frequency 16 Hz;frequency 60 MHz to 133 MHz","","10","9","22","IEEE","31 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their presence is now wide spread in sensitive areas such as home automation, industrial control systems, medical devices and security systems. As their popularity has increased, so has the urgency to protect and defend these networks. The decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection. RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting in improved classification performance of devices. Non-parametric classifier Random Forest is used with both parametric and non-parametric features to provide a classification performance comparison. Performance improvements of upto 9% in correct classification rates have been achieved and an effective gain of 4 dB SNR was realized.1","2329-6275","978-1-4673-7557-3","10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208645","","Zigbee;Signal to noise ratio;Authentication;Performance evaluation;Linear regression;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;Internet of Things;Zigbee","nonparametric feature generation;RF-fingerprinting;ZigBee devices;Internet of Things;ZigBee ad-hoc networks;nonparametric classifier random forest","","14","","22","IEEE","20 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To resolve concerns on performance, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM), and other techniques have been used in recent work. Such techniques indicate limitations and are not efficient for use in large data sets, such as system and network data. The intrusion detection system is used in analyzing huge traffic data; thus, an efficient classification technique is necessary to overcome the issue. This problem is considered in this paper. Well-known machine learning techniques, namely, SVM, random forest, and extreme learning machine (ELM) are applied. These techniques are well-known because of their capability in classification.

The special feature of these is the designing for operation in two modes: normal and emergency. Digital components can accumulate hidden failures over a long-term normal mode. This reduces their fault tolerance and functional safety of the system in the most responsible emergency mode. Two conditions for occurrence of the hidden fault problem as a growth one are considered in view of a resource approach, which in the development of models, methods and means highlights levels of replication and diversification. Safety-related systems are analyzed as computer systems that have increased to the level of diversification to address the security challenge. Their components are still stamped at a level of resource replication using matrix structures to process data in parallel codes. Fault-tolerant solutions become fault-safe with a sufficient level of circuit checkability, which is commonly known as testability, i.e. structural checkability, depending only on the structure of the circuit. In the operating mode, the checkability becomes structurally-functional, and in critical applications it is converted into a dual-mode, the shortage of which causes the hidden fault problem. A method of analyzing circuits for the possibility of hidden faults is suggested. The method is illustrated on example of an iterative array multiplier implemented in an FPGA project with a LUT-oriented architecture. A program model for the resulting scheme has been developed and potentially dangerous points have been found in it in which the hidden fault problem of may manifest itself.","","978-1-7281-5566-1","10.1109/TCSET49122.2020.235591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9088661","hidden fault;FPGA;LUT-oriented architecture;safety-related system;digital component;growth problem;resource approach;replication;diversification;matrix structure;checkability;iterative array multiplier;potentially dangerous points","","fault diagnosis;fault tolerance;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit reliability;logic design;multiplying circuits;safety;table lookup","hidden fault analysis;FPGA project;safety-related systems;long-term normal mode;fault tolerance;functional safety;responsible emergency mode;hidden fault problem;computer systems;LUT-oriented architecture;iterative array multiplier;matrix structures;circuit checkability","","16","","41","IEEE","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, a puncturable identity-based PRE (P-IB-PRE) scheme is proposed to efficiently protect the security and privacy of the group message. The proposed scheme introduces a message server as the proxy to transform ciphertext for each participant in the group; thus, the heavy computation overhead is delegated to the message server with abundant resources. Most importantly, our scheme enables the recipient to revoke its private key’s decryption capability of the specific messages without affecting other messages. Moreover, the identity-based mechanism eliminates the burden of certificate management as well as improves efficiency.

Security of online e-commerce over the Internet is provided through Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS). The SSL/TLS uses public key cryptographic algorithms which are computational intensive due to the modular multiplications. Therefore, SSL/TLS servers often become overloaded while performing public key decryptions when the simultaneous requests increase rapidly. Overload can lead e-commerce applications to considerable revenue losses, response times may grow to unacceptable levels and as a result the server may saturate even crash. So load management of SSL/TLS web server is a critical issue in e-commerce. The proposed work in this paper is to manage load on the server by applying Adaptive SSL policy and session handling mechanism. This policy is self-adaptive security, which offers great potential in providing timely and fine grained security control on server, by runtime adaptation of cryptographic algorithm. The implementation results in more efficient system with better throughput and response time.","","978-1-4673-0242-5","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295274","adaptive SSL;self adaptive security;session handling;load management","Cryptography;Protocols;Monitoring;Throughput;Web servers","computer network security;electronic commerce;file servers;Internet;public key cryptography","Web server load management;admission control mechanism;Internet based e-commerce;business necessity;online e-commerce;secure sockets layer;transport layer security;SSL-TLS servers;public key cryptographic algorithms;modular multiplications;public key decryptions;revenue losses;adaptive SSL policy;session handling mechanism;self-adaptive security;fine grained security control","","2","","13","IEEE","6 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These attacks take the form of a combination of various attack elements. APT attacks reflect this characteristic well. To defend against APT attacks, organizations should sufficiently understand these attacks based on the attack elements and their relations and actively defend against these attacks in multiple dimensions. Most organizations perform risk management to manage their information security. Generally, they use the information system risk assessment (ISRA). However, the method has difficulties supporting sufficiently analyzing security risks and actively responding to these attacks due to the limitations of asset-driven qualitative evaluation activities. In this paper, we propose a threat-driven risk assessment method. This method can evaluate how dangerous APT attacks are for an organization, analyze security risks from multiple perspectives, and support establishing an adaptive security strategy.","2770-6834","978-1-6654-6000-2","10.1109/REW56159.2022.00050","National Research Foundation; National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9920123","advanced persistent threat;risk-aware problem domain ontology;business process-based asset identification;threat-driven risk assessment;evidence-based risk evaluation","Conferences;Information security;Organizations;Ontologies;Risk management;Requirements engineering;Computer security","computer crime;ontologies (artificial intelligence);risk management","security risks;risk-aware problem domain ontology;cybersecurity attacks;attack elements;risk management;information system risk assessment;asset-driven qualitative evaluation activities;threat-driven risk assessment method;APT attacks;ISRA","","","","15","IEEE","20 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following the IEEE Standard 1547.4-2011, the operation and control of large distribution networks can be enhanced by dividing these networks into multiple virtual microgrids. The proposed planning framework incorporates the necessary conditions for microgrids to operate efficiently in grid-connected operating mode and successfully during islanding. To obtain a robust design, the clustering process considers three objectives: maximizing the self-adequacy of the designed microgrids, maximizing microgrid islanding success probability, and a combination of both targets. For this purpose, the PG&E distribution system with 69 buses is selected as a test case. Backtracking search optimization algorithm, a probabilistic load flow approach, and graph-based theories are used to accomplish this research. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the self-adequacy and the islanding success probability objectives in the clustering process. Compared with other strategies present in the previous literature, the proposed framework results in more self-sufficient and successful islands assessed in terms of active and reactive power adequacy as well as voltage constraints. Next, the effects of increased penetration level of DGs and installation of both distributed energy-storage units and distributed reactive sources on the design process are examined. Finally, a comparison with other microgrid design objectives applied in previous researches reveals that the resultant design is sensitive to the system's reliability, security, and economic requirements.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2019.2904319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681447","Backtracking search;clustering;islanding;microgrid design;optimization;reactive sources;self-adequacy;storage units","Microgrids;Load modeling;Reliability;Planning;Probability density function;Islanding;Optimization","distributed power generation;energy storage;graph theory;IEEE standards;load flow;optimisation;power distribution control;power distribution economics;power distribution faults;power distribution planning;power distribution reliability;power generation control;power generation economics;power generation planning;power generation reliability;power system security;probability;reactive power","graph theory;economic requirements;system reliability;system security;voltage constraints;multiple virtual microgrids;IEEE Standard 1547;multiple distributed generation units;distribution networks;planning framework;design process;distributed energy-storage units;reactive power adequacy;active power adequacy;clustering process;load flow approach;backtracking search optimization algorithm;PG&E distribution system;microgrid islanding","","41","","46","IEEE","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper focuses on a robust controller design scheme for inverter-interfaced distributed generators considering various operating modes and loading conditions of microgrids. Especially, during the island mode, the voltage and system frequency can easily change due to instant power mismatch between distributed generators and loads in the microgrid.

In a lockable obfuscation scheme there exists an obfuscation algorithm Obf that takes as input a security parameter, a program P, a message msg and lock value lck and outputs an obfuscated program oP. One can evaluate the obfuscated program oP on any input x where the output of evaluation is the message msg if P(x) = lck and otherwise receives a rejecting symbol. We proceed to provide a construction of lockable obfuscation and prove it secure under the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. Notably, our proof only requires LWE with polynomial hardness and does not require complexity leveraging. We follow this by describing multiple applications of lockable obfuscation. First, we show how to transform any attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme into one in which the attributes used to encrypt the message are hidden from any user that is not authorized to decrypt the message. (Such a system is also know as predicate encryption with one-sided security.) The only previous construction due to Gorbunov, Vaikuntanathan and Wee is based off of a specific ABE scheme of Boneh. By enabling the transformation of any ABE scheme we can inherent different forms and features of the underlying scheme such as: multi-authority, adaptive security from polynomial hardness, regular language policies, etc. We also show applications of lockable obfuscation to separation and uninstantiability results. We first show how to create new separation results in circular encryption that were previously based on indistinguishability obfuscation. This results in new separation results from learning with error including a public key bit encryption scheme that it IND-CPA secure and not circular secure. The tool of lockable obfuscation allows these constructions to be almost immediately realized by translation from previous indistinguishability obfuscation based constructions. In a similar vein we provide random oracle uninstantiability results of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation (and related transformations) from the lockable obfuscation combined with fully homomorphic encryption. Again, we take advantage that previous work used indistinguishability obfuscation that obfuscated programs in a form that could easily be translated to lockable obfuscation.","0272-5428","978-1-5386-3464-6","10.1109/FOCS.2017.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8104094","","Encryption;Standards;Electronic mail;Computer science;Complexity theory","computational complexity;public key cryptography","lockable obfuscation scheme;obfuscated programs;indistinguishability obfuscation based constructions;security parameter;lockable obfuscation;learning with errors;polynomial hardness;attribute-based encryption;IND-CPA secure;fully homomorphic encryption","","64","","81","IEEE","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two enhanced algorithms of Chaotic Neural Network and NeuroEvolution of the augmenting topology have been devised and applied on the fused features. To verify the trustworthiness of the proposed system, several experiments have been deployed on both unimodal and multimodal systems. After several experiments performed, the algorithms reveal that multi biometric system exhibit higher recognition rates and lower false rejection rates compared to unimodal systems.

Then it is noted that for different operating states represented by different weight (power flow) distribution at different time sections, the risks of cascading failures would be completely different. Inspired by the analysis of intersubnetworks power shifts in cascading failures, inverse-community (IC) structure is proposed in TWN to intuitively identify the risk of cascading failures. IC describes a structure in weighted networks with several communities in which the weighted interaction between communities is significantly stronger than that within the same community. Furthermore, the conventional modularity is upgraded as inverse-modularity (IM) to quantify the characteristic of IC structure in power networks. Subsequently, considering the risk of cascading failures represented by IM and the cost of power network operation, a security/economic dispatch (SED) method is designed to handle the optimal power dispatch issues. Simulation results prove a positive correlation between IM of power flow distribution and risk of cascading failures. Furthermore, the results on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SED method in mitigating cascading failure risks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3189001","Research Development Fund of Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University(grant numbers:RDF-15-02-14,RDF-18-01-04); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51877181); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9817092","Cascading failure;complex network;Internet of Things (IoT);inverse-community (IC) structure;security/economic dispatch (SED);temporal weighted network","Power system protection;Power system faults;Power grids;Load flow;Internet of Things;Load modeling;Integrated circuit modeling","Internet of Things;load flow;power engineering computing;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power grids;power system security","cascading failures;Internet of Things;inverse-community structure;optimal power dispatch issues;power flow distribution;power grids;power network operation;security-economic dispatch method;SED method;temporal weighted networks","","","","43","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The appropriate implementation of numerous cloud computing models aids firms in digital transformation and development with maximum productivity. However, CC integration with IoT allows an extraordinary capability and boosts economies’ ability to develop at a fast pace. Meanwhile, due to the rapid expansion of IoT, the current cloud network cannot keep abreast of the growing data loads and processing extremities, particularly in real-time. Even the most cutting-edge cloud providers are experiencing an inordinate strain as a result of the growing number of consumer and corporate devices connected to the IoT. While it has a centralized design, it lacks bandwidth and has downtime issues. High latency, lack of location awareness, outage concerns, etc., are among the issues that cloud services for IoT confront. Furthermore, due to uninterrupted operating states, the massive volume of data created by the IoT is increasing enormously. IoT devices are creating a flood of data, disrupting predictable data processing and analytics capabilities well managed by the cloud. As a result, securing this ocean of data has become an elite concern for researchers and cyber experts, as organizations jeopardize their reputation and users’ privacy and security. Fog computing (FC) technology has been used, which analyses and acts on the data by bringing the cloud close to the commodities, ultimately reducing the response time.

In this paper, using minutiae and orientation features from two different fingerprints, a new unique mixed fingerprint template is generated. The advantage of creating the mixed template is that it is cancellable and serves as a new virtual identity. Further Gabor feature of the mixed template is extracted before matching to reduce the error rate. Testing the templates is done using 2 methods, viz: correlation based and minutiae based.

In uncontrolled environments like telephone speech applications, the gender recognition system should be adaptive, accurate, and robust to noisy environments. This paper presents a reasoning method governed by Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence for automatic gender recognition from telephone speech. The proposed method uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients with a support vector machine to generate the initial prediction results for individual speech segments. The reasoning scheme collects and validates results from support vector machine and treats convincing predictions as valid evidence. It is argued that the consideration of valid evidence in the reasoning process improves recognition performance by avoiding unconvincing classification results.

Thus, if user's biometric is compromised, it might be impossible or highly difficult to replace it in a particular system. Cancellable biometric for individual biometric has been a significantly understudied problem. The concept of cancelable biometric or cancelability is to transform a biometric data or feature into a new one so that users can change their single biometric template in a biometric security system. However, cancelability in multimodal biometric has been barely addressed at all. In this paper, we tackle the problem and present a novel solution for cancelable biometrics in multimodal system.

Since the total production loss from both events was quite large, some improvements have been implemented to prevent the recurrence of similar events in the future. They consist of installing the sequence of events recorder at the generator output terminal, regulating the generator lagging power factor operation from 0.95-0.99 to 0.91, adjusting the tap position to decrease the secondary voltage of the 161 kV/161 kV interconnecting transformer, operating the phase-leading capacitors attached with a multi-stage chain cut-off control unit, and running two or three generators in automatic voltage regulation mode instead of automatic power factor regulation mode. Although similar events occurred twice at the same power plant in 2006, the generating units were capable of continuous stable operation which had effectively verified the improvements of operational changes.

By realization of an SMTR® Module suitable to a folded plank concept a significant reduction of installation depth could be achieved. As the module weight is dominated by its package, technology evaluation and implementation of advantageous concepts and materials was performed, here. Cost reduction is always a key focus of T/R module evolution as the modules still allocate a big part of antenna's production cost. Some steps have been realised here both on technology and component level. The next generation of AESA antennas will result in a combination of different operating modes within the same antenna front end, including radar, communication (data links), and jamming (electronic warfare, EW). This leads to enhanced demands especially towards the MMICs. The RF section of today's T/R modules for AESA applications is typically based on GaAs technology. During the last 10 years there was much progress in the development of disruptive semiconductor materials, especially GaN and SiGe BiCMOS, which have the potential to challenge or even replace the GaAs technology, here. This paper will describe and show this evolution through the last years and shall give an outlook towards future developments with regard to airborne applications.","1097-5764","978-1-4799-4195-7","10.1109/RADAR.2014.7060400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060400","T/R Module;AESA;X-Band;Airborne","Substrates;Radio frequency;Gallium nitride;Arrays;Radar antennas;Spaceborne radar","airborne radar;beam steering;ceramic packaging;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;integrated circuit packaging;jamming;MMIC;radar antennas;remote sensing by radar","airborne applications;active electronically steered antenna;X-band antenna;airborne radar;fighter nose radar;satellite based SAR antenna;earth observation;ground surveillance;security radar;active airborne antenna;transmit-receive module;standardized module;LTCC package technology;SMTR module;folded plank concept;cost reduction;T/R module;antenna production cost;MMIC;AESA applications;disruptive semiconductor materials;jamming;antenna front end;GaAs","","10","","11","IEEE","16 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is based on edge orientation matching (EOM) and subsequent candidate verification using a SNoW (Sparse Network of Winnows) classifier in the final stage. We have developed a simple and efficient EOM method for object modeling and matching using edge orientation information only. To make the system more robust, we verify face candidates obtained by the EOM with a view-based SNoW classifier which operates directly on the grey values. For further speedup, the pipelined matcher is combined with a coarse-to-fine grid scan of the image. On average, it thus requires less than 10% of all possible image locations to be processed by the detection pipeline. With this method, it takes 50 ms on an Athlon 1000-MHz PC to analyze an image of spatial size 384/spl times/288 pixels. Experimental results on a large database of 18,704 grey still images with 19,030 detectable frontal faces, including the M2VTS (Multi-Modal Verification for Teleservices and Security applications) frontal face database, the CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) test set of H.A. Rowley and S. Baluja (1996) and the newly released BioID (Biometric Identification) test set, show that the presented approach outperforms methods that use neural networks, Bayesian methods and support vector machines (SVMs) by far in terms of computational efficiency while showing comparable detection results.

The accuracy of the face detection system relies on the quality of the image registration procedure. In this paper, we propose an enhanced intensity-based image registration technique for thermal and visible facial images. The method uses a histogram matching scheme to equalize the intensity levels of the IR/visible images for proper image registration.

Integration of biometric pattern matching into an identity management system (IMS) enhances security of transactions and improves ease of use. Privacy of users in a biometric based system is improved by using keys generated directly from feature sets instead of conventional stored templates. This paper proposes a framework for integrating biometric key based authentication into an IMS. The generated keys need to be consistent. Consistency of keys is attained if the same key is generated for every instance of biometric input. Generation of long and consistent keys directly from feature sets poses a challenge due to intra and inter user variations inherent to biometric data. A novel methodology for generating consistent keys using principles of vector quantization and cluster based learning is introduced. 15-bit keys have been extracted from handwritten signature datasets. The results are promising and can be extended to multi-modal biometric feature sets.","2159-3450","978-1-5386-5457-6","10.1109/TENCON.2018.8650543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8650543","Identity management system;user privacy;consistent keys;clustering","Feature extraction;Privacy;Authentication;Bioinformatics;Cryptography;IEEE Regions","authorisation;cryptography;data privacy;feature extraction;handwriting recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;set theory;vectors","IMS;user privacy;digital transactions;identity management system;biometric based system;conventional stored templates;biometric key based authentication;inter user variations;vector quantization;cluster based learning;multimodal biometric feature sets;biometric based consistent key generation;biometric pattern matching;intra user variations;handwritten signature datasets","","1","","35","IEEE","24 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are also some works those have attempted to integrate multi-modal cues, e.g. clothes and social relations. While showing improvements, they still have some limitations, such as designing too many objective functions to guide the model and relying on simple heuristics to combine multi-modal cues. In this paper, we propose a new framework to solve the above problems. Specifically, our model consists of three branches to extract and fuse information under three modalities respectively.

Today, security is the most important concern. Biometric authentication technologies are becoming more popular as a method of verifying people’s identities. Biometric systems also add a layer of convenience for the user. They make it unnecessary for the user to “remember” numerous passwords for various apps, for example. A biometric system that uses a single biometric trait to identify persons must deal with issues such as spoof attacks, trait non-universality, substantial intra-class variability, limited degrees of freedom, and noisy data. Multi-modal biometrics, on the other hand, can be quite useful in this case because they do not have the same set of issues as unimodal biometrics.

Biometric authentication has gained popularity as the system for implicit, non-intrusive and progressive authentication because it has no memory load or carry-along requirements. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in facial biometrics research and we examine facial authentication techniques and the emerging usage of multi-modal biometrics such as various combinations of periocular, iris and face biometrics to ensure better user security.

Applications of UAVs in urban environments include photography and film-making, security monitoring, real estate, construction, property and infrastructure inspections, leisure, public safety (fires, natural disasters, investigations), traffic, and much more. Emerging UAV applications include last-mile drone delivery services. This paper discusses urban scenarios where drones are more ubiquitous. Monitoring and related safety of these UAVs will be increasingly important. Though multi-modal purpose-built drone tracking and monitoring systems will be the most effective solution for detection and tracking of these RPAS, during the transition to more regular drone use in urban areas and in everyday urban applications, a more rapid-deployment and agile detection system is needed that does not require installation of hardware.

This paper aims to develop an efficient system for driving stress detection under real driving circumstances. Multiple physiological signals, i.e., electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and respiration (RESP) were collected and multi-modal features were extracted from time, spectral, and wavelet domains. The proposed approaches are motivated by three points: 1) Obvious individual difference affects the transferability of trained models to a new drive. Then, through dissimilarity evaluation and hierarchical clustering, we searched for subgroups of drives that presented relatively consistent feature distributions. Performing cross-drive modeling within each subgroup enables us to identify driver statuses more precisely with less computation cost; 2) fusing the high-dimensional physiological data from multiple views is beneficial to achieve a reliable assessment but brings new challenges for existing techniques. We adopted Multi-view Intact Space Learning (MISL) to integrate rich information from multiple perspectives by constructing a latent intact representation of the data; 3) most of the existing systems are offline. The current study made both offline and online analysis to validate the effectiveness of this research. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approaches can achieve competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods and can be developed into intelligent in-vehicle systems to detect driver’s unfavorable statuses, better adjust their negative affection, and avoid traffic accidents.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3120435","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976091,61806078); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9597480","Driving stress;hierarchical clustering;multi-view learning;physiological signals","Stress;Vehicles;Feature extraction;Biomedical monitoring;Physiology;Task analysis;Electrocardiography","driver information systems;electrocardiography;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;patient monitoring;physiology;road accidents;road safety;skin;wavelet transforms","stress detection;driving circumstances;multiple physiological signals;galvanic skin response;multimodal features;trained models;hierarchical clustering;relatively consistent feature distributions;performing cross-drive modeling;driver statuses;high-dimensional physiological data;Multiview Intact Space Learning;latent intact representation;traffic accidents;stress estimation;detecting driver;ensuring driving security","","1","","51","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem of high dimensionality of the combined features is overcome by the used of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in the feature extraction phase. One challenge in multi modal feature level fusion is to maintain the balance of the features selected between the two modalities, otherwise one modality may outweigh another. In order to address this issue, we propose to perform feature fusion in the feature selection phase. Feature selection using GA with modified fitness function is applied to the concatenated features in order to ensure that only significant and most balanced features are used for classification.

In satellite MEC, the raw data of edge users vested in different owners cannot be allowed to be shared, considering data privacy requirements. To address this, federated learning (FL) architecture can be applied to satellite MEC where only parameters and model updates can be transmitted, which avoids the interaction of raw data from diverse sources. In this article, we construct a FL-based satellite MEC architecture, followed by introducing its key techniques in the aspects of resource management and multi-modal data fusion.

ClickLeak is built on the observation that each key input makes unique pattern of hand and finger movements, and this generates unique distortions to multi-path Wi-Fi signals. Acceleration and microphone sensors of smart phones determine the starting and ending time of keystrokes, while the time series of channel state information are analyzed to determine the keystrokes. The evaluation results have shown that with large scale data collections from public social settings, the key recognition accuracy can reach higher than 83%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2776527","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61772077,61370192,61432015); U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1319915,CNS-1343355); NSFC(grant numbers:61572347); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8118065","Cyberspace;channel state information;social computing;data privacy;social network services","Wireless fidelity;Pins;Social network services;Sensors;Time series analysis;Receivers;Wireless sensor networks","authorisation;cyber-physical systems;data privacy;microphones;smart phones;social sciences computing;time series;wireless channels;wireless LAN","keystroke leaks;multimodal sensors;public social environments;PIN code/password;numeric keypad;commodity Wi-Fi devices;multipath Wi-Fi signals;microphone sensors;keystrokes;public social settings;cyberphysical social networks;ClickLeak;acceleration sensors;smart phones;smart phones;channel state information;time series;key recognition accuracy","","9","","36","OAPA","22 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the robustness of the recognition process becomes a major problem. When identifying unseen categories with traditional finger-vein recognition systems, a few issues remain, such as recognition interference and low efficiency. This paper proposes a Deep Generalized Label Finger-Vein (DGLFV) model to extract feature maps and achieve high-accuracy recognition. The largest rectangular finger-vein region is extracted through image semantic segmentation and the advanced bidirectional traversing and center diffusion method for the known categories. Then we generalize all the unseen categories actively as Class  $C+1$  to reduce interference from unregistered users. Furthermore, an adaptive threshold acquisition algorithm is proposed for Label Receiver Operating Characteristic (LROC), so that the procedures of classification, recognition, and verification are unified. Apart from Shandong University Homologous Multi-modal Traits (SDUMLA-HMT), we have conducted additional experiments on our self-built database, Finger Veins of Signal and Information Processing Laboratory (FV-SIPL). The recognition accuracy of the approach proposed in this paper has reached 99.25% and 99.08% testing on FV-SIPL and SDUMLA-HMT, with a low error rate at 1.481% and 2.228% and little time consumption of 0.157s for a single image, which is better than most state-of-the-art finger-vein recognition methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3084037","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1403303); Science and Technology Tackling Key Project of the Educational Department of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:LJ2020ZD005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9440904","DGLFV;finger-vein recognition;generalized category;FV-SIPL;SDUMLA-HMT","Feature extraction;Veins;Image segmentation;Robustness;Semantics;Image recognition;Face recognition","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;security of data;self-organising feature maps;vein recognition","advanced bidirectional traversing;center diffusion method;DGLFV;recognition interference;high-accuracy recognition;deep generalized label finger-vein model;deep generalized label algorithm for finger-vein recognition;label receiver operating characteristic;rectangular finger-vein region;information security;feature maps;image semantic segmentation;adaptive threshold acquisition algorithm;LROC;Shandong University Homologous Multi-modal Traits;Finger Veins of Signal and Information Processing Laboratory;FV-SIPL;SDUMLA-HMT;time 0.157 s","","9","","41","CCBY","26 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, trained artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as Support vector machine (SVM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been proposed to recognize distinct and discriminant features of biometric information (intrinsic hand features and demographic cues) with good classification accuracy. Unfortunately, due to nonlinearity in distinct and discriminant features of biometric information, accuracy of SVM and ANFIS is reduced. As a result, optimized AI algorithms ((ANFIS) with subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC) and SVM with error correction output code (SVM-ECOC)) have shown to be effective for biometric information recognition. In this paper, we compare the performance of the ANFIS-SC and SVM-ECOC algorithms in their effectiveness at learning essential characteristics of intrinsic hand features and demographic cues based on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) feature selection. Furthermore, the accuracy of these algorithms are presented, and their recognition performances are evaluated by root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), scatter index (SI), mean absolute deviation (MAD), coefficient of determination  $(R^{2})$ , Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICc) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency index (NSE). Evaluation results show that both SVM-ECOC and ANFIS-SC algorithms are suitable for accurately recognizing soft biometric information on basis of intrinsic hand measurements and demographic cues. Moreover, comparison results demonstrated that ANFIS-SC algorithms can provide better recognition accuracy, with RMSE, AICc, MAPE,  $R^{2}$  and NSE values of  $\leq3.85$ , 2.39E+02, 0.18%,  $\geq 0.99$  and  $\geq 99$ , respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3171850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766125","ANFIS;artificial intelligence;biometric features recognition;demographic cues;SVM;misclassifications;optimization","Artificial intelligence;Support vector machines;Biological system modeling;Inference algorithms;Indexes;Wrist;Fingerprint recognition","artificial intelligence;biometrics (access control);error correction codes;feature extraction;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;image coding;mean square error methods;support vector machines","biometric information recognition;multimodal gaze estimation;trained artificial intelligence algorithms;distinct features;discriminant features;intrinsic hand features;demographic cues;optimized AI algorithms;ANFIS-SC;SVM-ECOC algorithms;recognition performances;mean absolute deviation;Akaike's Information Criterion;soft biometric information;recognition accuracy","","7","","46","CCBY","2 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is one of the most interesting subjects in this area. The Re-ID system is divided into two main stages: i) extracting feature representations to construct a person's appearance signature and ii) establishing the correspondence/matching by learning similarity metrics or ranking functions. However, appearance based person Re-Idis a challenging task due to similarity of human's appearance and visual ambiguities across different cameras. This paper provides a representation of the appearance descriptors, called signatures, for multi-shot Re-ID First, we will present the tracklets, i.e trajectories of persons. Then, we compute the signature and represent it based on the approach of Part Appearance Mixture (PAM). An evaluation of the quality of this signature representation is also described in order to essentially solve the problems of high variance in a person's appearance, occlusions, illumination changes and person's orientation/pose. To deal with variance in a person's appearance, we represent it as a set of multi-modal feature distributions modeled by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Experiments and results on two public datasets and on our own dataset show good performance.","2474-0446","978-1-5386-5305-0","10.1109/SSD.2018.8570441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8570441","Person Re-Identification (Re-ID);Part Appearance Mixture (PAM);tracklet;signature representation","Feature extraction;Visualization;Tracking;Cameras;Trajectory;Lighting","feature extraction;Gaussian processes;image matching;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;video surveillance","signature representation;multimodal feature distributions;video surveillance;security;safety;Re-ID system;called signatures;multishot Re-ID First;multishot person reidentification;feature representation extraction;human appearance;tracklet representation;similarity metrics learning;appearance based person re-Id;visual ambiguities;appearance descriptor representation;part appearance mixture;PAM;Gaussian mixture model","","","","22","IEEE","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, In-band Network Telemetry (INT) has presented its unique capabilities in acquiring the insights of a network and thus has been adopted in many production networks. However, less attention was put on the potential threats on INT (e.g., the man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojan horse injection) that may falsify network measurements resulting in catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a secure INT architecture called SINT that can effectively mitigate INT vulnerabilities and can be implemented using ‘chiplet’ based multi-modal network processors (MNP). SINT adopts blockchain technology into INT, in which a network status snapshot acquired via INT is viewed as a block and added into a network telemetry blockchain to prevent arbitrary access and malicious modification. To minimize the intrusiveness of the INT and blockchain operations, SINT is designed to be a lightweight protocol and uses improved RAFT consensus mechanisms to reduce its network and computing overhead. The design of the chiplet MNP system makes SINT highly flexible and adaptive to facilitate INT convergence and related blockchain updates. In the SINT architecture, INT tasks and blockchain operations are dispatched to different chips to achieve an optimal trade-off among measurement accuracy, security requirements, and computing resource on the data plane. Experiments and simulations show that SINT can alleviate most cyberattacks on INT and retain 97% of bandwidth utilization for other users’ normal traffic in a complex scenario with 500 nodes. Furthermore, SINT converges the INT results quickly and accurately with minor overhead compared to that of the state-of-art INT methods.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2023.3269891","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1800602); China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M710677); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107633","INT;blockchain;multi-modal network processor;security","Blockchains;Telemetry;Computer architecture;Security;Current measurement;Control systems;Task analysis","blockchains;computer network security;invasive software;security of data;telemetry","blockchain operations;blockchain technology;blockchain-based;chiplet based multimodal network processors;In-Band Network Telemetry Architecture;INT convergence;INT results;INT tasks;INT vulnerabilities;managed network;network management;network measurements;network status snapshot;network telemetry blockchain;production networks;related blockchain updates;secure INT architecture;SINT architecture;state-of-art INT methods","","","","50","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The development and deployment of a fully connected transportation system that makes the most of multi-modal, transformational applications requires a robust, underlying technological platform. The platform is a combination of well-defined technologies, interfaces, and processes that, combined, ensure safe, stable, interoperable, reliable system operations that minimize risk and maximize opportunities. The primary application area of connected vehicles is the vehicle safety. These applications are designed to increase situational awareness and reduce or eliminate crashes through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) data transmission that supports: driver advisories, driver warnings, and vehicle and/or infrastructure controls. These technologies may potentially address a great majority of crash scenarios with unimpaired drivers, preventing tens of thousands of automobile crashes every year. Since V2V and V2I communications and a significant data processing are involved, the connected vehicles concept also requires resiliency and immunity for cyber security issues. This panel session will discuss technology, applications, dedicated short range communications (DSRC) technology and capabilities, policy and institutional issues, and international research on the subject matter.","","978-1-4673-6741-7","10.1109/ITEC.2015.7165725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165725","","Accidents;Connected vehicles;Reliability;Systems operation;Vehicle safety","","","","","","","IEEE","27 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
