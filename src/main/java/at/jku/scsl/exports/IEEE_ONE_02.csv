"A Secure and Reliable Platform Configuration Change Reporting Mechanism for Trusted Computing Enhanced Secure Channels","K. Dietrich","Microcomputing Laboratory, Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz, Austria","2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","12 Dec 2008","2008","","","2137","2142","The security of well established secure channel technologies like transport layer security (TLS) or IP security (IPSec) can be significantly improved by emerging concepts like trusted computing. The use of trusted platform modules (TPMs) offers new methods for improving the security of these well established technologies. How secure channel technologies can be adapted to use trusted computing concepts is subject to current research. A major part of this research addresses the integration of the TCG's specified remote attestation. Remote attestation enables a platform to provide a trustworthy proof of its current configuration (i.e. software that has been loaded on the platform). Hence, based on this proof, a remote platform can decide whether to open a channel to another platform or not. In current approaches, the proof of the platform configuration is processed before a secure channel is established, which is not opened if the reported configuration is not accepted by the hosts. However, one important problem has not been solved yet. Currently, no satisfying solution how the change of a platform's configuration can be securely and reliably reported to the remote platform whilst a channel is open, exists. A reliable method to provide a proof for a configuration change can be implemented with only minor modifications of the TPM specification and the TLS protocol. Experimental results show that it is possible to implement this proof mechanism with only a few additional TPM commands.","","978-0-7695-3398-8","10.1109/ICYCS.2008.530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4709304","Trusted computing;platform configuration reporting;secure channels;TLS","Information security;Computer security;Protocols;Proposals;Cryptography;Information processing;Laboratories;Information retrieval;Certification","computer network reliability;cryptographic protocols;IP networks;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;transport protocols","reliable platform configuration change reporting mechanism;trusted computing;secure channel technology;transport layer security;IP security;trusted platform module;TLS protocol;TPM specification;cryptographic protocol","","1","1","14","IEEE","12 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper discusses the need for adaptive security and privacy in smart grids by presenting some motivating scenarios.

Cyber-Physical Systems can be harmed through both cyber-enabled or physically-enabled attacks, particularly ones that exploit the often ignored interplay between the cyber and physical spaces characterizing a system operating environment. Awareness of the topology of the operating environment of systems as well as its dynamics can support adaptive security more effectively. In this talk I propose the use of Bigraphical Reactive Systems to represent the topology of cyber and physical spaces. I describe how to use this representation to reason about the consequences of the evolution of topological configurations on the satisfaction of security requirements. I also illustrate a planning technique to identify an adaptation strategy to be used at runtime, to circumvent, prevent, or mitigate security requirements violations previously identified. Finally I will describe how this approach has been integrated into an existing commercial access control software.","","978-1-5386-2797-6","10.1109/SER-IP.2017..21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964357","","Security;Topology;Software;Conferences;Software engineering;Cyber-physical systems;Adaptive systems","authorisation;cyber-physical systems","cyber-physical systems;physically-enabled attacks;cyber-enabled attacks;system operating environment;bigraphical reactive systems;planning technique;adaptation strategy;commercial access control software","","","","","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is now normal for performance and availability of such systems to be carefully measured and evaluated. Contracts that include financial penalties in case of breach are now common. However security is lagging behind this trend; it is as important to stakeholders as performance and availability, but is generally not included in the scope of service-level agreements between stakeholders, and handled instead on a best-effort basis, without any transparency nor SLA with their clients. One reason for this is the difficulty of objectively measuring security. Indeed, the actual security level of a system is dependent on a wide range of factors, some intrinsic to the system - such as a design or implementation mistake resulting in a vulnerability - and some extrinsic to it. For instance, an external event such as the publication of a vulnerability in an open-source software dependency or a change of political context in a country can widely impact the risks faced by an information system even if no actual change were made to the system. These factors are even more numerous in multi-tenant cloud infrastructures because of the sheer number of actors involved - and their sometimes conflicting incentives - and opportunities for both attack and defense at scale. Security monitoring aims to detect and react to attacks in real time; Reactive security monitoring intends to take external events into account while doing so. Improving the accuracy of a system's overall security assessment can help transitioning security to a SLA paradigm and enable better transparency for all stakeholders.","","978-1-5386-5175-9","10.1109/FAS-W.2018.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599521","Security;Cloud;SLA;IDS","Security;Software;Cloud computing;Information systems;Prototypes;Monitoring;Contracts","cloud computing;contracts;public domain software;security of data","multitenant cloud;external event;security assessment;transparency;adaptive security monitoring;cloud computing;service-level agreements;information systems stakeholders;financial penalties;best-effort basis;actual security level;open-source software dependency;information system;actual change;reactive security monitoring","","2","","17","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach avoids weaknesses of traditional RBAC approaches and provides a practically usable security model for multi-agent systems (MAS). A unified role interaction model framework has been put forward that incorporates not only functional requirements but also security constraints in MAS. A security policy rule scheme has been used to express security requirements in relation to affective roles. The major contribution of the work is that little redevelopment effort will be required when security is to be engineered into the overall MAS architecture, hence minimising the impact of the security requirements changes to the MAS architecture.

One of its most valuable features is its threat detection function which is available on every version of the firewall running a software version of 8.0(2) or higher. Threat detection operates at layers 3 and 4 to determine a baseline for network traffic, analysing packet drop statistics and generating threat reports based on traffic patterns. Despite producing a large volume of statistical information relating to several security events, further effort is required to mine and visually report more significant information and conclude the security status of the network. There are several commercial off-the-shelf tools available to undertake this task, however, they are expensive and may require a cloud subscription. Furthermore, if the information transmitted over the network is sensitive or requires confidentiality, the involvement of a third party or a third-party tool may place organisational security at risk. Therefore, this paper presents a fuzzy logic aided intelligent threat detection solution, which is a cost-free, intuitive and comprehensible solution, enhancing and simplifying the threat detection process for all. In particular, it employs a fuzzy reasoning system based on the threat detection statistics, and presents results/threats through a developed dashboard user interface, for ease of understanding for administrators and users. The paper further demonstrates the successful utilisation of a fuzzy reasoning system for selected and prioritised security events in basic threat detection, although it can be extended to encompass more complex situations, such as complete basic threat detection, advanced threat detection, scanning threat detection, and customised feature based threat detection.","","978-1-5090-6020-7","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2018.8491574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491574","","Firewalls (computing);Feature extraction;Fuzzy logic;Tools;Monitoring;Fuzzy reasoning","computer crime;firewalls;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;organisational aspects;user interfaces","organisational networks;valuable features;threat detection function;software version;network traffic;analysing packet drop statistics;traffic patterns;statistical information;significant information;security status;third-party tool;organisational security;fuzzy logic;intelligent threat detection solution;comprehensible solution;threat detection process;fuzzy reasoning system;threat detection statistics;prioritised security events;complete basic threat detection;advanced threat detection;customised feature based threat detection;Cisco adaptive security appliance 5500 series firewall","","15","","28","Crown","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the implementation of the security activities are influenced by criteria which are interdependent to each other and dynamic. Those criteria are experience, skill and knowledge; teams workload; development team size; development timeline; and cost/budget. Therefore, the selection of security activities must be based on the priority of the criteria and adaptive. This paper addresses the adaptive security activities selection model as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) issue. Analytic Network Process (ANP) is proposed for weight calculation and criteria prioritization. Hypothetical examples were presented based on hard constraints faced by in-house web-based application development team in two different scenarios. The Decision Maker made the judgement by using the online ASAS model. The results show that experience, skill and knowledge get the highest priority in the first scenario while budget/ cost get the highest priority in the second scenario. These prioritization will be used as a major requirement in security activities selection.","","978-1-7281-3306-5","10.1109/AINS47559.2019.8968709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8968709","security activities selection model;analytic network process","","decision making;security of data;software development management","weight calculation;in-house Web-based application development team;decision maker;MCDM;analytic network process;online ASAS model;multicriteria decision making;adaptive security activities selection model;development timeline;development team size;software development life cycle;ANP;criteria prioritization","","1","","39","IEEE","27 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With new requirements imposed by SOA-based business models, adaptive security enforcement on the application level becomes even more important. Our work on the enforcement framework to date has resulted in a comprehensive middleware-based solution leveraging on Web services technologies. However, potential merits of hardware-based solutions to further secure application exposure have not been considered so far. This paper describes a method for combining software resource level security features offered by Web services technologies, with the hardware-based security mechanisms offered by trusted computing platform and system virtualisation approaches. In particular, we propose trust-based architecture for protecting the enforcement middleware deployed at the policy enforcement endpoints of Web and grid services.

Identifying and evaluating assets are therefore key activities in any security engineering process - from modeling threats and attacks, discovering existing vulnerabilities, to selecting appropriate countermeasures. However, despite their crucial role, assets are often neglected during the development of secure software systems. Indeed, many systems are designed with fixed security boundaries and assumptions, without the possibility to adapt when assets change unexpectedly, new threats arise, or undiscovered vulnerabilities are revealed. To handle such changes, systems must be capable of dynamically enabling different security countermeasures. This paper promotes assets as first-class entities in engineering secure software systems. An asset model is related to requirements, expressed through a goal model, and the objectives of an attacker, expressed through a threat model. These models are then used as input to build a causal network to analyze system security in different situations, and to enable, when necessary, a set of countermeasures to mitigate security threats. The causal network is conceived as a runtime entity that tracks relevant changes that may arise at runtime, and enables a new set of countermeasures. We illustrate and evaluate our proposed approach by applying it to a substantive example concerned with security of mobile phones.","2332-6441","978-1-4673-2785-5","10.1109/RE.2012.6345794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345794","Security requirements;Adaptation;Causal reasoning","Security;Adaptation models;Runtime;Mobile handsets;Credit cards;Analytical models;Usability","security of data;software engineering;systems analysis","requirements-driven adaptive security;security engineering process;secure software systems;undiscovered vulnerabilities;security countermeasures;secure software engineering systems;variable asset protection","","43","","25","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Streaming refers to downloading software to client hardware platforms for temporary local execution. OS and application software is managed from a centralized server and provided only on-demand. Users obtain a clean, consistent, current build each time they log in, removing the nuisance of security patching and rebooting for environmental changes. Local execution and caching preserves user experience comparable to traditionally installed applications. To explore feasibility, Intel conducted a proof-of-concept (POC) to evaluate streaming in its call center and manufacturing environments on multi-user systems. The four-part study included performance, usability, IT operations and total cost of ownership (TCO). The proof-of-concept was successful in identifying streaming as a feasible technology with good performance and positive TCO in the tested scenarios. The biggest benefits were related to locking down the client and thus eliminating service calls related to configuration changes, software installation and viruses. The major challenges encountered were around the high learning curve and the software maturity related to packing applications for streaming. Based on the strong positive outcome of the POC, Intel has added streaming to its IT roadmaps.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-17-5","10.1109/PICMET.2008.4599691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599691","","Software;Streaming media;Manufacturing;Cities and towns;Africa;Servers;Computational modeling","DP industry","Intel case study;software on demand;software as a service approach;software streaming;proof-of-concept","","","2","","","15 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed waveform has three modes of operation and maximum achievable throughput of 1.33 Mbps. The user throughput of the proposed hybrid waveform is compared with the classical CDMA scheme using the same bandwidth. Due to higher spectral efficiency provided by CPM, it is shown that the proposed waveform achieves higher throughput for appropriate choice of pulse length L and modulation index h as compared to the CDMA based waveform.

At the planning stage, the defender can utilize software diversity, which is a common phenomenon that the cyber software of different substations comes from different competing vendors. Therefore, different kinds of software may not be exposed to the same zero-day security loophole, preventing the attacker from taking charge of multiple substations at the same time. In this paper, the optimal scheme of software deployment considering long-term risk mitigation is studied. Firstly, the framework of diversity-based cyber defense against malicious attacks is formulated. Secondly, the risk index based on representative attack patterns is constructed, which is the objective to be minimized. Thirdly, considering that the deployment scheme is long-term stable while the operating mode varies with time, we construct a multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming to mitigate the average risk of operating modes. Then the optimization problem is solved by the multiobjective genetic algorithm. Lastly, results of the IEEE 39-node CPPS and and the Virtual European Grid demonstrate that the proposed method can considerably reduce the attack risk.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3086681","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2017YFB0903000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1766203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447199","Cyber-physical power system;multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA);nonlinear integer programming;risk mitigation;stochastic programming;software diversity","Substations;Cyberattack;Software;Power systems;Indexes;Security;Risk management","computer crime;cyber-physical systems;genetic algorithms;nonlinear programming;power engineering computing;power generation protection;power grids;power system security;risk management;software engineering;stochastic programming;substations","diversity-based cyber defense;malicious attacks;risk index;representative attack patterns;attack risk;software deployment;long-term risk mitigation;cyber-physical power systems;wide-area cyber attacks;software diversity;cyber software;zero-day security loophole;substations;multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming;optimization;multiobjective genetic algorithm;IEEE 39-node CPPS;virtual European grid","","1","","38","IEEE","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we describe a methodology for analyzing and understanding the RBAC-configuration evolution, its relation to the overall evolutionary lifecycle of industrial systems, and its impact on security vulnerabilities from which the system may suffer. Our methodology considers two different sources of information regarding the RBAC-configuration evolution: 1) the role-permissions matrices of subsequent system versions; and 2) the corresponding concept lattices, implied by these matrices. By examining the evolution of these two system properties, developers can easily notice which versions involve more and more complex RBAC-configuration changes that may indicate higher security risks.

An assured and trusted baseline is key to detecting atypical or malicious traffic. A testbed has been developed that models the regular ATM-grade IP-network behavior. The sample configuration uses open source stacks ElastiFlow, and SELKS to provide network flow data collection and visualization and demonstrate resilience against hacking attempts via unauthorized communication and protocols between nodes, unauthorized configuration changes via distribution of parameters to network nodes, as well as detection of malicious communication attempts from unauthorized devices on the network. A Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture is chosen as it features a programmable, efficient network configuration improving network performance and monitoring. The OpenFlow protocol is used to provide the control plane in the testbed. Data flows will be modeled as synchronous as well as asynchronous. Vulnerabilities are then identified, attack scenarios defined and applied to the testbed setup. The available SDN platform tools are then used to detect the anomalies.

We propose PUFSec, a new device fingerprint-based security architecture for IoT devices. By leveraging intrinsic hardware characteristics, we aim to design a computationally lightweight security software system architecture so that complex cryptography computation can dramatically be prohibited. We exploit the innovative idea of Public Physical Unclonable Functions (PPUFs) that fundamentally protects attackers from recovering the secret key from public gate delay information. We implement its hardware logic in a real-world FPGA board. On top of the PPUF fingerprint hardware, we present an adaptive security control mechanism consisting of adaptive key generation and key exchange protocol, which adjusts security strength depending on system load dynamics. We demonstrate that our PPUF FPGA implementation embeds distinctive variability enough to distinguish between two different PPUFs with high fidelity. We validate our PUFSec architecture by implementing necessary algorithms and protocols in a real-world IoT platform, and performing empirical evaluation in terms of computation and memory usages, proving its practical feasibility.","","978-1-5090-5336-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057146","","Hardware;Logic gates;Delays;Cryptography;Software;Radiation detectors","cryptographic protocols;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;Internet of Things;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;telecommunication security","low-end embedded platform;security enhancement;computation overhead;IoT devices;intrinsic hardware characteristics;computationally lightweight security software system architecture;complex cryptography computation;Public Physical Unclonable Functions;secret key;public gate delay information;hardware logic;real-world FPGA board;PPUF fingerprint hardware;adaptive security control mechanism;adaptive key generation;key exchange protocol;security strength;system load dynamics;PPUF FPGA implementation;PUFSec architecture;real-world IoT platform;device fingerprint-based security architecture;Internet of Things","","9","","13","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we use SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs, classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks).","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.2971213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8981946","IoT;device monitoring;flow characteristics;machine learning","Monitoring;Telemetry;Performance evaluation;Object recognition;Machine learning;Cameras;Internet of Things","computer network security;firmware;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic;telemetry","nonIoTs;real traffic traces;IoT cyber-security;cyber-security risks;Internet of Things devices;network operators;network monitoring technologies;network switches;programmable flow-based telemetry;flexible data-driven models;network activity;traffic flows;network behavior;real consumer IoT devices;flow-level attributes;SDN paradigm;machine learning;time-series attributes;firmware upgrade;cyber attacks","","38","","57","IEEE","4 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a distributed approach to multi-robot exploration which always keeps all the robots in communication range. The algorithm is based on a utility function that guarantees communication while using best effort for the exploration itself. The robots randomly sample configuration changes of the overall system, i.e., the set of the next best joined movements based on this utility function. This process can be very well distributed with very few communication overhead by having each robot computing a part of the sample and broadcasting its best candidate configuration change found.

Isolation of tenants is essential for a stable and secure operation of a factory. Application upgrades and novel software enable faster innovation cycles. Secure remote management allows more outsourcing to third parties but leads to continuously changing factory networks. Mobile or even autonomous devices again add complexity. However, current factory owners are conservative for good reasons: changing a well-designed system is costly and may cause failures and outages of the production lines. The virtual tenant network (VTN) concept addresses this conflict by means of combining network virtualization, hardware virtualization, cloud technologies and IT automation. Thus, tenants are isolated and configuration changes or security breaches in one tenant will not affect others. The concept at hand borrows from data center technology but adopts those ideas to the embedded world of industrial networks.","","978-1-7281-0568-0","10.1109/NetSys.2019.8854508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854508","virtual tenant network;edge-cloud;multi-tenant;industrial communication","Production facilities;Couplings;Cloud computing;Quality of service;Security;Stakeholders;Virtualization","cloud computing;computer centres;factory automation;mobile computing;virtualisation","stable operation;secure operation;application upgrades;secure remote management;factory networks;network virtualization;configuration changes;security breaches;multitenant networks;automation industry;future industrial networks;innovation cycles;autonomous devices;virtual tenant network concept","","","","12","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

""Having Divided to Conquer We Must Reunite [to] Rule"". Decomposition of problems and systems into smaller, more manageable units has been at the heart of software engineering practice for decades. ""Separation of concerns"" gives software engineers the conceptual and practical tools to focus their attention, and their tools, on the parts of the problem or solution to which they are best suited. Perhaps one of the earliest boundaries used to separate concerns is that which exists between hardware and software - once that boundary is drawn, software engineers were able to focus their attention on the development of software within the hardware boundaries chosen. There has however, been a steady erosion of such boundaries: digital and physical connectivity have become the norm, and increasingly such connectivity can be ad hoc, spontaneous, and often unplanned (perhaps best exemplified by the Internet of Things paradigm). Moreover, the fluid and disappearing boundaries between technology and people have radically affected social behaviours (again, perhaps well exemplified by the proliferation of mobile and ubiquitous computing such as wearable and 'smart' technologies used in variety of personal and community settings). Such convergence between digital, physical, and social spaces has provided exciting opportunities for software engineers to, literally, 'cross boundaries', and, as a result, to have an impact on the physical and social worlds in which the software they build will operate. But in this brave new world with porous boundaries, security engineering and privacy management challenges abound. Effective security depends on the ability to control access to assets protected by boundaries. Effective privacy management depends on informed, consensual sharing of information across boundaries. Our thesis is that, although increasingly invisible, and rightly so, explicit awareness and sometimes representation of boundaries in cyber-physical-social systems facilitate good old fashioned separation of concerns, which in turn enables more effective software engineering of secure, privacy-aware software. We support our thesis with examples from our research in adaptive security and privacy.","","978-1-5386-4043-2","10.1109/SEsCPS.2017.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968016","adaptive security and privacy;cyber-physical-social systems","Software;Security;Privacy;Software engineering;Tools;Conferences;Cyber-physical systems","software engineering","crossing boundaries;digital spaces;physical spaces;social spaces;software engineering practice;software engineers;physical connectivity;Internet of Things;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing;wearable;smart technologies;porous boundaries;security engineering;privacy management;cyber-physical-social systems;privacy-aware software;adaptive security","","","","","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, most discovery tools use manually written rules, which require specific knowledge of software and systems. Approaches based on manually written rules are often fragile and require constant maintenance in this era of continuous integration. In this paper, we propose a novel “discovery by example” approach to autonomously search for and identify system changes. Our approach learns characteristic features of system changes automatically, without requiring any explicit rule definitions or specific knowledge of the underlying software or systems. In this approach, given a system change, our method searches a repository that contains previous stored system changes and returns those that are similar to it. We further explore the use of various forms of “fingerprints” to represent system changes efficiently and faithfully in a compact manner. We propose and evaluate two types of fingerprints: the “basename fingerprint” and the “1-D histogram fingerprint”. We show that both fingerprints exhibit different efficiency and accuracy trade-offs, and they can be effectively employed in different use cases. We evaluate the performance of our approach with both techniques and further present an application of it in system real-time streaming monitoring.","","978-1-4799-5666-1","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004217","","Software;Histograms;Fingerprint recognition;Feature extraction;Big data;Security;Monitoring","computer centres;software packages","software installation;security patches;cloud platforms;base-name fingerprint;1-D histogram fingerprint","","7","","18","IEEE","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key solution to achieve this goal is to integrate multiple avionic systems, apply new signal processing and RF capabilities. A generalized and reconfigurable architecture of Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) with integrated and modularised structure based on Direct RF Sampling (DRFS) and Software Defined Radio (SDR) is presented in this paper for avionic applications. The proposed architecture is composed of a DRFS digital receiver integrated within a SDR software modules. DRFS technology is adopted in the digital receiver, which consists of Pre-selection Filters and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to provide flexible compatibility for diverse modulation modes and various RF/IF frequency bands. By employing the concept of DRFS/SDR, distinct procedures for different avionic purposes, such as Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing System (ILS), can be achieved in the same hardware platform. Notably, this proposed architecture has the potential to be reconfigured and improved in several ways without any hardware change to accommodate new features and signal capabilities. As per experimental validation phase, an MMR integrated system for VOR and ILS receivers has been designed and implemented. Test results have illustrated that the implementation feasibility of multi-mode DRFS avionic receivers is beneficial and efficient using the proposed architecture. Moreover, the benefits obtained from this new approach are not only covering miniaturization, lightweight, and low power consumption but is also promising to overreach the equivalent commercial systems in the future.","2375-5318","978-1-4673-8823-8","10.1109/RADAR.2017.7944467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7944467","Avionic;DRFS;SDR;MMR;IMA;VHF;VOR;ILS","Aerospace electronics;Receivers;Radio frequency;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Band-pass filters;Mixers","avionics;instrument landing systems;radio receivers;software radio","direct RF sampling;avionic systems;VOR;ILS receiver;aerospace industry;avionic architecture;cost reduction;weight reduction;maintenance complexity;RF efficiency;signal processing;generalized architecture;reconfigurable architecture;multimode receiver;MMR;integrated structure;modularised structure;software defined radio;SDR;DRFS digital receiver;SDR software modules;pre-selection filters;field programmable gate arrays;FPGA;flexible compatibility;diverse modulation modes;RF-IF frequency bands;very-high-frequency omnidirectional range;instrument landing system;hardware platform;MMR integrated system;multimode DRFS avionic receivers;power consumption","","6","","16","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we have implemented the operation of lights through the voice-controlled home automation system by giving voice commands as an input to the system for the user to turn ON and turn OFF the lights at home. The system mainly uses the Raspberry Pi module, which happens to be an important component of our smart light system implementation. It consists of both hardware and software components, which have a speech recognition module implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has voice commands that can be understood, and accordingly, lights can be operated with its usage. It has a special feature that when the light gets turned ON or OFF, it will be ensured to the user through an audio output by the speaker. The main working of a voice-automated system depends on the recognition of the voice given by the user as an input. Raspberry Pi module keeps all electrical home appliances connected through a single interface for complete smart home system automation. Today's modern world is shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems with less human intervention, as result, the use of manual operating switches is slowly deteriorating. In this paper, we have used voice recognition for operating the home appliances where there is no need to use the conventional switches, and hence human effort required for the system is comparatively very less. Research work on smart home systems mainly aims to satisfy the needs, which help elderly and disabled people etc. in operating home appliances without any helping support from others.

The basic principle of the scheduling algorithm is detected to increase the chance of mimicry escape. This paper designs a dynamic scheduling mechanism with diversified algorithms, which increases the complexity and dynamics of the scheduling mechanism, and can effectively reduce the risk of the scheduler being sniffed. Experimental results show that, compared with the traditional scheduling mechanism, the proposed diversified and dynamic scheduling scheme can significantly reduce the risk of the scheduler being attacked, and further improve the security of the mimicry defense system.","","978-1-6654-4322-7","10.1109/SPAC53836.2021.9539990","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9539990","Mimicry Defense;Algorithm Diversification;Dynamic Scheduling Mechanism","Uncertainty;Scheduling algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Simulation;Software algorithms;Computer architecture;Dynamic scheduling","dynamic scheduling;security of data","execution scheduler;single algorithm;static algorithm;diversification dynamic scheduling mechanism;execution pool;hardware diversification technology;heterogeneous redundant configuration;software diversification technology;multimode output vector;point-surface fusion defense mechanism;retransmission attack;network space mimicry defense based algorithm","","","","11","IEEE","27 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

System operator's acceptance of advanced network functions and integration into their daily work functions has been accomplished at Houston Lighting and Power Company (HL&P) by redesigning the user interface and many of the associated systems needed to provide the correct operating state to the network models.

Security is important in data protection so as not to be infringed by unauthorized parties. If the vulnerabilities found are not amended, it leads to cyber-attacks such as Structured Query Language Injection Attack (SQLIA) performed by certain parties which enable them to gain unauthorized data access. To cater security issues, variety of security frameworks for secure software development life cycle (SDLC) were introduced. Secure SDLC is created by integrating security-related activities to an each phase of in used development methodologies such as waterfall model or agile model. However, the application security problem continues to grow. Strict, complicated and heavyweight frameworks are underutilized due to several factors. The factors that influence the implementation of secure SDLC identified in public sector (the scope is State Secretary Offices in Malaysia) are inadequate development timeline, improper development team size and less awareness of team members' workload. It is agreed that integrating security at earlier (requirement and design) phase is the most effective and cheapest way to develop secure web application. Hence, an adaptive secure SDLC model is proposed to integrate security activities using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) focusing on the influence factors as the main criteria and meet the international and local secure frameworks standards. The proposed model will recommend adaptive security activities as a guideline to be applied at earlier phases of SDLC to help eliminate/ minimize the web application vulnerabilities and increase the application security and implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype at selected Malaysian public sector for in-house web application development.","","978-1-5386-6925-9","10.1109/AINS.2018.8631401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8631401","web application;security activities;secure SDLC;in-house web application development;public sector","Security;Software;NIST;Information technology;Testing","analytic hierarchy process;data protection;fuzzy set theory;Internet;security of data;software engineering;SQL","structured query language injection attack;software development life cycle;Malaysian public sector;SQLIA;waterfall model;FAHP;fuzzy analytic hierarchy process;agile model;health organizations;financial organizations;in-house web application development;local secure frameworks standards;international frameworks standards;adaptive secure SDLC model;unauthorized data access;cyber-attacks;data protection","","","","46","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For that reason, SMM has been exploited in the past to facilitate attacks, misuse, or alternatively, building security tools capitalising on its resources.

Threat modeling allows for a by-design approach, mitigating problems before they arise and avoiding later costly development efforts. However, it mainly pays off in software construction approaches that rely on planned architectures, in which sources of threats can be anticipated beforehand. These axiomatic assumptions are, however, increasingly untrue in contemporary software development practices in which software systems evolve drastically in later stages. In addition, software-intensive systems are increasingly faced with uncertainty in their operational contexts, and these are nearly impossible to enumerate in early development stages. In this article, we first present the idea of reflective threat modeling, which involves the automated derivation of architectural system models from run-time and operational system artifacts, providing the threat modeler with an accurate and workable run-time inspection view of the system. We then outline and motivate the potential of adopting threat analysis models as a basis for holistic and adaptive threat management through integration of adaptive security and privacy technologies.

Cybersecurity has also been considered in such efforts as a contributor to these environmental issues. Nonetheless, most green security approaches focus on designing low-overhead encryption schemes and do not emphasize energy-efficient security from architectural and deployment viewpoints. This paper sheds light on the emerging paradigm of adaptive cybersecurity as one of the research directions to support sustainable computing in green IoT.

Such devices will however be broadly used only if they are ""prescribed"" by the hospitals as a part of a therapy and are reimbursed by the insurances. For this we need the proof of their safety, medical efficacy and economic efficiency. Aside of obligatory clinical trials we need an extensive system of post-market surveillance, because: a medical device is a part of a complex cyber-physical system, with humans in the loop / the environment cannot be sufficiently defined / humans react differently to the therapy, they also behave differently / after every software upgrade the device is not the same as before In their operation such devices generate huge amounts of data that can be reused for such analysis. Technically oriented people believe it can be done using a Big Data Analytics system without a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. It is doubtful if such approach can deliver useful results. The main problems seem to be: unbalanced cohort / various patient groups with various preferences / multiple quality parameters (basic algorithm, signal propagation, battery, security & privacy, obtrusiveness, etc.) / multiple variants (operating modes, device settings) / variability of the device and of the environment. When we transform data into ""actionable knowledge"", especially if the generated decisions influence human health, utmost care has to be applied.

Multimedia has become the biggest of big data as the foundation of today's data-driven discoveries. Almost all disciplines of science and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data in some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security surveillance. Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-time broadcast of unfolding events on social networks. Multimedia data is not just big in volume, but also multi-modal and mostly unstructured. Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, and recognizing from the vast amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. Even though significant progress has been made processing multimedia data, today's solutions are inadequate in handling data from millions of sources simultaneously.

This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments. Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM, designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and waiver-granted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADS-B, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network. Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and non-compliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS. The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we will present our experimental design and current test data from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM, and GA shared airspace research.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-0649-6","10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9081710","fail-safe;fail-secure;UAS;UTM;UAM;GPS;ADS-B","","aerospace computing;air traffic control;aircraft navigation;autonomous aerial vehicles;cloud computing;control engineering computing;data mining;Global Positioning System;inertial navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;sensor fusion","inertial navigation systems;security threats;safe sUAS-UAM shared airspace;secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace;passive visual sensor nodes;acoustic sensor nodes;air traffic control;acoustic arrays;urban UAS operating region;Class-D airspace;Drone Net approach;ground radar;Drone Net network;fail-secure property;ground sensor network;ground-system sensor fusion;UTM flight plan;fail-secure methods;multiple UAS;regional cloud-based networks;multisensor drone detection;Drone Net project;global cloud-based networks;UAS traffic management network;fail-safe experiments;ADS-B;GPS;Global Positioning System;UAM airspace;UAM vehicles;heterogeneous drone shapes;innovative aviation designs;air taxi service;urban air mobility;unmanned aerial systems;urban airspace;UAM traffic;fail-secure experiments;flight instruments;airspace safety;flight sensor network","","7","","43","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this, cybersecurity monitoring of vehicle fleets is required to detect and respond to potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities. The aim of this research is to explore a technological approach to fleet monitoring using established IT standards and techniques. The approach involves collecting, filtering, and forwarding cybersecurity information from multiple sources within the vehicle by instrumenting the ROS 2-based architecture and integrating these data sources with the log management tool syslog-ng. The logging configuration can be adapted at runtime using a ROS 2 interface that we developed. The approach is demonstrated with our fleet simulation setup “Fleet in the Loop” and a sophisticated data collection in a Knowledge Graph. The approach at hand can be used to seamlessly integrate ROS 2 in common IT monitoring tools and efficiently increase the resilience of vehicles by integrating adaptive security monitoring.","2157-9865","979-8-3503-3549-1","10.1109/VNC57357.2023.10136321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10136321","cybersecurity monitoring;vehicles;resilience;container;ROS 2;syslog-ng;network monitoring;security","Runtime;Filtering;Soft sensors;Instruments;Computer architecture;Knowledge graphs;Computer security","computer network management;computer network reliability;computer network security;cyber-physical systems;mobile computing;semantic networks;vehicular ad hoc networks","adaptive cybersecurity monitoring;adaptive security monitoring;cyber threats;cybersecurity information;data collection;data sources;fleet in the loop;fleet monitoring;fleet simulation setup;IT monitoring tools;IT standards;knowledge graph;logging configuration;resilient vehicular architectures;ROS 2 interface;ROS 2-based architecture;software components;syslog-ng log management tool;vehicle fleets","","","","37","IEEE","1 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Toward this end, we propose the use of a multi-robot system for autonomous and cooperative counter-UAS missions. In this paper, we present the design of the hardware and software components of different complementary robotic platforms: a mobile uncrewed ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a LiDAR sensor, an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) with a gimbal-mounted stereo camera for air-to-air inspections, and a UAV with a capture mechanism equipped with radars and camera. Our proposed system features 1) scalability to larger areas due to the distributed approach and online processing, 2) long-term cooperative missions, and 3) complementary multimodal perception for the detection of multirotor UAVs. In field experiments, we demonstrate the integration of all subsystems in accomplishing a counter-UAS task within an unstructured environment. The obtained results confirm the promising direction of using multi-robot and multi-modal systems for C-UAS.","2475-8426","978-1-6654-5680-7","10.1109/SSRR56537.2022.10018733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018733","","Scalability;Robot vision systems;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Cameras;Software;Safety;Security","aerospace robotics;aircraft control;autonomous aerial vehicles;cameras;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;optical radar;stereo image processing","air-to-air inspections;autonomous counter-UAS missions;complementary robotic platforms;cooperative counter-UAS missions;field testing;LiDAR sensor;mobile uncrewed ground vehicle;multimodal systems;multirobot system;security solutions;software components;system features;UAV;uncrewed aerial systems;uncrewed aerial vehicle","","","","27","IEEE","24 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
