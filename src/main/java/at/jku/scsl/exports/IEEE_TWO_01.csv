"A Secure and Reliable Platform Configuration Change Reporting Mechanism for Trusted Computing Enhanced Secure Channels","K. Dietrich","Microcomputing Laboratory, Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz, Austria","2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","12 Dec 2008","2008","","","2137","2142","The security of well established secure channel technologies like transport layer security (TLS) or IP security (IPSec) can be significantly improved by emerging concepts like trusted computing. The use of trusted platform modules (TPMs) offers new methods for improving the security of these well established technologies. How secure channel technologies can be adapted to use trusted computing concepts is subject to current research. A major part of this research addresses the integration of the TCG's specified remote attestation. Remote attestation enables a platform to provide a trustworthy proof of its current configuration (i.e. software that has been loaded on the platform). Hence, based on this proof, a remote platform can decide whether to open a channel to another platform or not. In current approaches, the proof of the platform configuration is processed before a secure channel is established, which is not opened if the reported configuration is not accepted by the hosts. However, one important problem has not been solved yet. Currently, no satisfying solution how the change of a platform's configuration can be securely and reliably reported to the remote platform whilst a channel is open, exists. A reliable method to provide a proof for a configuration change can be implemented with only minor modifications of the TPM specification and the TLS protocol. Experimental results show that it is possible to implement this proof mechanism with only a few additional TPM commands.","","978-0-7695-3398-8","10.1109/ICYCS.2008.530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4709304","Trusted computing;platform configuration reporting;secure channels;TLS","Information security;Computer security;Protocols;Proposals;Cryptography;Information processing;Laboratories;Information retrieval;Certification","computer network reliability;cryptographic protocols;IP networks;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;transport protocols","reliable platform configuration change reporting mechanism;trusted computing;secure channel technology;transport layer security;IP security;trusted platform module;TLS protocol;TPM specification;cryptographic protocol","","1","1","14","IEEE","12 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These threats typically manifest themselves at runtime as new usage scenarios arise and vulnerabilities are discovered. Adaptive security and privacy promise to address these threats by increasing awareness and automating prevention, detection and recovery from security and privacy requirements' failures at runtime by re-configuring system controls and perhaps even changing requirements. This paper discusses the need for adaptive security and privacy in smart grids by presenting some motivating scenarios.

It is now normal for performance and availability of such systems to be carefully measured and evaluated. Contracts that include financial penalties in case of breach are now common. However security is lagging behind this trend; it is as important to stakeholders as performance and availability, but is generally not included in the scope of service-level agreements between stakeholders, and handled instead on a best-effort basis, without any transparency nor SLA with their clients. One reason for this is the difficulty of objectively measuring security. Indeed, the actual security level of a system is dependent on a wide range of factors, some intrinsic to the system - such as a design or implementation mistake resulting in a vulnerability - and some extrinsic to it. For instance, an external event such as the publication of a vulnerability in an open-source software dependency or a change of political context in a country can widely impact the risks faced by an information system even if no actual change were made to the system. These factors are even more numerous in multi-tenant cloud infrastructures because of the sheer number of actors involved - and their sometimes conflicting incentives - and opportunities for both attack and defense at scale. Security monitoring aims to detect and react to attacks in real time; Reactive security monitoring intends to take external events into account while doing so. Improving the accuracy of a system's overall security assessment can help transitioning security to a SLA paradigm and enable better transparency for all stakeholders.","","978-1-5386-5175-9","10.1109/FAS-W.2018.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599521","Security;Cloud;SLA;IDS","Security;Software;Cloud computing;Information systems;Prototypes;Monitoring;Contracts","cloud computing;contracts;public domain software;security of data","multitenant cloud;external event;security assessment;transparency;adaptive security monitoring;cloud computing;service-level agreements;information systems stakeholders;financial penalties;best-effort basis;actual security level;open-source software dependency;information system;actual change;reactive security monitoring","","2","","17","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

""Having Divided to Conquer We Must Reunite [to] Rule"". Decomposition of problems and systems into smaller, more manageable units has been at the heart of software engineering practice for decades. ""Separation of concerns"" gives software engineers the conceptual and practical tools to focus their attention, and their tools, on the parts of the problem or solution to which they are best suited. Perhaps one of the earliest boundaries used to separate concerns is that which exists between hardware and software - once that boundary is drawn, software engineers were able to focus their attention on the development of software within the hardware boundaries chosen. There has however, been a steady erosion of such boundaries: digital and physical connectivity have become the norm, and increasingly such connectivity can be ad hoc, spontaneous, and often unplanned (perhaps best exemplified by the Internet of Things paradigm). Moreover, the fluid and disappearing boundaries between technology and people have radically affected social behaviours (again, perhaps well exemplified by the proliferation of mobile and ubiquitous computing such as wearable and 'smart' technologies used in variety of personal and community settings). Such convergence between digital, physical, and social spaces has provided exciting opportunities for software engineers to, literally, 'cross boundaries', and, as a result, to have an impact on the physical and social worlds in which the software they build will operate. But in this brave new world with porous boundaries, security engineering and privacy management challenges abound. Effective security depends on the ability to control access to assets protected by boundaries. Effective privacy management depends on informed, consensual sharing of information across boundaries. Our thesis is that, although increasingly invisible, and rightly so, explicit awareness and sometimes representation of boundaries in cyber-physical-social systems facilitate good old fashioned separation of concerns, which in turn enables more effective software engineering of secure, privacy-aware software. We support our thesis with examples from our research in adaptive security and privacy.","","978-1-5386-4043-2","10.1109/SEsCPS.2017.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968016","adaptive security and privacy;cyber-physical-social systems","Software;Security;Privacy;Software engineering;Tools;Conferences;Cyber-physical systems","software engineering","crossing boundaries;digital spaces;physical spaces;social spaces;software engineering practice;software engineers;physical connectivity;Internet of Things;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing;wearable;smart technologies;porous boundaries;security engineering;privacy management;cyber-physical-social systems;privacy-aware software;adaptive security","","","","","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Engineering adaptive security is not an easy task. A set of effective security countermeasures should be identified. These countermeasures should not only be applied to (primary) assets that customers desire to protect, but also to other (secondary) assets that can be exploited by attackers to harm the primary assets. Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions. Third, the paper illustrates our approach through a set of adaptive security scenarios in the customer domain of a smart grid. We suggest that modeling secondary assets aids the deployment of countermeasures, and, in combination with a representation of assets variability, facilitates the design of monitoring functions.","2157-2321","978-1-4673-1787-0","10.1109/SEAMS.2012.6224403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224403","Adaptive security;Smart grid;Assets;Adaptive software","Security;Home appliances;Smart grids;Cameras;Monitoring;Buildings;Energy management","asset management;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","valuable asset management;security control;security countermeasures;primary assets;engineering adaptive security requirement;secondary assets;customer domain;smart grid;asset variability;monitoring function","","4","","8","IEEE","25 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive security solution for Mobile Devices (Smartphone, Tablets,...) based on the combination of the MAPE-K reference model to dynamic negotiate and deploy of security policies, and DSPL approach to reconfigure the security level of the applications at runtime and monitor the changes in the context.

The first is to reduce hardware management-related issues when working with complex networks, such as a lack of flexibility and scalability with regard to global configuration changes. The second is to create a communication library that provides programmable network function virtualization, helping to achieve the first aim. Specifically, we target low-cost, security-oriented networks that use broadband routers as L3 switches. When such networks have multiple IP domains between the external gateway and internal networks, domains that are lower in the hierarchy become more secure, but at the cost of flexibility. Our proposed system architecture aims to increase communication flexibility in such networks without requiring complex encapsulation and achieves this goal via a practical method that does not change the packet size. Finally, we conduct tests using an experimental implementation of the system, demonstrating its scalability.","2165-8536","978-1-5386-4646-5","10.1109/ICUFN.2018.8436656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8436656","Software Defined Network;Private Network;Network Management System","Scalability;Systems architecture;Logic gates;Libraries;Network function virtualization;System software;IP networks","computer network management;internetworking;IP networks;protocols;telecommunication security;virtualisation","multiple IP domains;hardware management-related issues;complex networks;global configuration changes;communication library;programmable network function virtualization;security-oriented networks;communication flexibility;complex encapsulation","","","","7","IEEE","16 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identifying and evaluating assets are therefore key activities in any security engineering process - from modeling threats and attacks, discovering existing vulnerabilities, to selecting appropriate countermeasures. However, despite their crucial role, assets are often neglected during the development of secure software systems. Indeed, many systems are designed with fixed security boundaries and assumptions, without the possibility to adapt when assets change unexpectedly, new threats arise, or undiscovered vulnerabilities are revealed. To handle such changes, systems must be capable of dynamically enabling different security countermeasures. This paper promotes assets as first-class entities in engineering secure software systems. An asset model is related to requirements, expressed through a goal model, and the objectives of an attacker, expressed through a threat model. These models are then used as input to build a causal network to analyze system security in different situations, and to enable, when necessary, a set of countermeasures to mitigate security threats. The causal network is conceived as a runtime entity that tracks relevant changes that may arise at runtime, and enables a new set of countermeasures. We illustrate and evaluate our proposed approach by applying it to a substantive example concerned with security of mobile phones.","2332-6441","978-1-4673-2785-5","10.1109/RE.2012.6345794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345794","Security requirements;Adaptation;Causal reasoning","Security;Adaptation models;Runtime;Mobile handsets;Credit cards;Analytical models;Usability","security of data;software engineering;systems analysis","requirements-driven adaptive security;security engineering process;secure software systems;undiscovered vulnerabilities;security countermeasures;secure software engineering systems;variable asset protection","","43","","25","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cyber-Physical Systems can be harmed through both cyber-enabled or physically-enabled attacks, particularly ones that exploit the often ignored interplay between the cyber and physical spaces characterizing a system operating environment. Awareness of the topology of the operating environment of systems as well as its dynamics can support adaptive security more effectively. In this talk I propose the use of Bigraphical Reactive Systems to represent the topology of cyber and physical spaces. I describe how to use this representation to reason about the consequences of the evolution of topological configurations on the satisfaction of security requirements. I also illustrate a planning technique to identify an adaptation strategy to be used at runtime, to circumvent, prevent, or mitigate security requirements violations previously identified.

Our approach avoids weaknesses of traditional RBAC approaches and provides a practically usable security model for multi-agent systems (MAS). A unified role interaction model framework has been put forward that incorporates not only functional requirements but also security constraints in MAS. A security policy rule scheme has been used to express security requirements in relation to affective roles. The major contribution of the work is that little redevelopment effort will be required when security is to be engineered into the overall MAS architecture, hence minimising the impact of the security requirements changes to the MAS architecture.

These role-permissions assignment rules, as well as the types of system users and system functionalities, evolve over time. In this paper, we describe a methodology for analyzing and understanding the RBAC-configuration evolution, its relation to the overall evolutionary lifecycle of industrial systems, and its impact on security vulnerabilities from which the system may suffer. Our methodology considers two different sources of information regarding the RBAC-configuration evolution: 1) the role-permissions matrices of subsequent system versions; and 2) the corresponding concept lattices, implied by these matrices. By examining the evolution of these two system properties, developers can easily notice which versions involve more and more complex RBAC-configuration changes that may indicate higher security risks. We demonstrate our methodology using a study of four popular real-world systems: 1) MediaWiki; 2) Moodle; 3) Joomla; and 4) WordPress.

Context-based security is an emerging approach for modeling adaptive security solutions based on the situation of use of the system. Our contribution aims at presenting a new model for specifying context-based security policies. This approach is based on contextual graphs and relies on a set of contextual information collected from the system and user's environments.","","0-7695-2106-1","10.1109/PERCOMW.2004.1276923","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1276923","","Context modeling;Information security;Communication system security;Access control;Pervasive computing;Context-aware services;Cryptographic protocols;Software engineering;Frequency;Application software","ubiquitous computing;graph theory;security of data;data privacy","services providers;ubiquitous computing;pervasive computing;context-based security;adaptive security solutions;contextual graphs;contextual information","","8","2","13","IEEE","30 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This interconnectivity enables new functionality but also new attack vectors.Today, agencies mostly rely on commercial security solutions providing adequate protection for commercial data services but have deficiencies when it comes to the Air Traffic Management (ATM) environment with its requirement for highest resilience, multi-level redundancies, and dynamic environment.This paper introduces a novel approach to create an ATM-grade baseline integrating operational security events (OSE) and alerts (OSA) based on abnormal or malicious network traffic. An assured and trusted baseline is key to detecting atypical or malicious traffic. A testbed has been developed that models the regular ATM-grade IP-network behavior. The sample configuration uses open source stacks ElastiFlow, and SELKS to provide network flow data collection and visualization and demonstrate resilience against hacking attempts via unauthorized communication and protocols between nodes, unauthorized configuration changes via distribution of parameters to network nodes, as well as detection of malicious communication attempts from unauthorized devices on the network. A Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture is chosen as it features a programmable, efficient network configuration improving network performance and monitoring. The OpenFlow protocol is used to provide the control plane in the testbed. Data flows will be modeled as synchronous as well as asynchronous. Vulnerabilities are then identified, attack scenarios defined and applied to the testbed setup. The available SDN platform tools are then used to detect the anomalies. Sets of experiments are performed and the results compared and discussed.","2155-4951","978-1-6654-3584-0","10.1109/ICNS52807.2021.9441630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9441630","","Protocols;Navigation;Telecommunication traffic;Machine learning;FAA;Traffic control;Tools","air traffic control;aircraft navigation;authorisation;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;data visualisation;IP networks;protocols;redundancy;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","OpenFlow protocols;unauthorized configuration changes;network nodes;malicious communication attempts;unauthorized devices;software defined network architecture;programmable network configuration;efficient network configuration;network performance improvement;anomaly detection;Federal Aviation Administration;air navigation service providers;data service consumers;interconnectivity;attack vectors;commercial security solutions;commercial data services;air traffic management environment;multilevel redundancies;dynamic environment;ATM-grade baseline;operational security events;abnormal network traffic;malicious network traffic;atypical traffic;regular ATM-grade IP-network behavior;sample configuration;open source stacks;network flow data collection;data visualization;hacking attempts;unauthorized communication;ElastiFlow;ATM-grade software defined networks;Air Navigation Service Providers;operational security alerts;SELKS;network monitoring","","","","12","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the selection of security activities must be based on the priority of the criteria and adaptive. This paper addresses the adaptive security activities selection model as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) issue. Analytic Network Process (ANP) is proposed for weight calculation and criteria prioritization. Hypothetical examples were presented based on hard constraints faced by in-house web-based application development team in two different scenarios. The Decision Maker made the judgement by using the online ASAS model. The results show that experience, skill and knowledge get the highest priority in the first scenario while budget/ cost get the highest priority in the second scenario.

Combining information flow and risk analyses could make fault-mode evaluations for such devices more efficient and cost-effective. Conducting high-grade information security evaluations for computer communications devices is intellectually challenging, time-consuming, costly, and error prone. We believe that our structured approach can reveal potential fault modes because it simplifies evaluating a device's logical design and physical construction. By combining information-flow and risk-analysis techniques, evaluators can use the process to produce a thorough and transparent security argument. In other work, we have applied static analysis techniques to the evaluation problem, treating a device's schematic circuitry diagram as an information flow graph. This work shows how to trace information flow in different operating modes by representing connectivity between components as being conditional on specific device states. We have also developed a way to define the security-critical region of components with particular security significance by identifying components that lie on a path from a high-security data source to a low-security sink. Finally, to make these concepts practical, we have implemented them in an interactive analysis tool that reads schematic diagrams written in the very high speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) hardware description language.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2006.161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631944","Security and protection;Data communications devices;Computer applications-military;Communications","Circuit faults;Information security;Military computing;Very high speed integrated circuits;Government;Military communication;Application software;Electronic components;Risk analysis;Computer errors","safety-critical software;fault diagnosis;hardware description languages;integrated circuit layout","fault-mode evaluation;security-critical communication devices;information security evaluation;risk-analysis techniques;transparent security argument;static analysis techniques;schematic circuitry diagram;information flow graph;very high speed integrated circuit;VHSIC;hardware description language","","6","","12","IEEE","15 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This problem is exacerbated for those operational technology (OT) networks supporting industrial control systems (ICS) since much of that equipment was originally designed to be on a network that was isolated and generally considered free of malefactors. Increasing pressure to bridge these systems with traditional information technology (IT) networks has introduced a bevy of new threats. In response, both academia and industry have responded with security solutions tailored to ICS environments. Deploying these protection systems often involves several configuration choices. While some of these choices are clear (e.g., block/enable protocol X) others are far more subjective (e.g. alert threshold == 3.43). Further complicating the situation, while often similar to IT networks, OT networks have unique challenges and characteristics that make the task of protecting them simultaneously more difficult and straight forward. Extant solutions for quantifying the relative security of intrusion detection systems fail to effectively support the operators of said systems with understanding the impact of various configuration changes. Further, they assume that the attacks are static and not subject to manipulation or alteration in the face of defenses. In this paper, we present a threat-based method for quantifying the relative impact of various security settings for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) within ICS environments. This method provides operational staff with a clear understanding of the relative impact of their settings and assumes that the attacks levied against them are dynamic. The model is described in detail, we apply the model to a synthetic data set, and discuss the inferences that can be made and what types of decisions they could be used to support.","","978-1-7281-6389-5","10.1109/ICPS48405.2020.9274691","Battelle; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274691","industrial control systems;intrusion detection systems;assessment;risk quantification","Security;Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;Software;Government;Task analysis;Risk management","computer network security;industrial control;local area networks;production engineering computing","security-relevant settings;anomaly-based intrusion detection;industrial control systems;OT networks;intrusion detection systems;Ethernet-based network;operational technology networks;configuration changes;IDS;ICS","","1","","19","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Isolation of tenants is essential for a stable and secure operation of a factory. Application upgrades and novel software enable faster innovation cycles. Secure remote management allows more outsourcing to third parties but leads to continuously changing factory networks. Mobile or even autonomous devices again add complexity. However, current factory owners are conservative for good reasons: changing a well-designed system is costly and may cause failures and outages of the production lines. The virtual tenant network (VTN) concept addresses this conflict by means of combining network virtualization, hardware virtualization, cloud technologies and IT automation. Thus, tenants are isolated and configuration changes or security breaches in one tenant will not affect others.

At the planning stage, the defender can utilize software diversity, which is a common phenomenon that the cyber software of different substations comes from different competing vendors. Therefore, different kinds of software may not be exposed to the same zero-day security loophole, preventing the attacker from taking charge of multiple substations at the same time. In this paper, the optimal scheme of software deployment considering long-term risk mitigation is studied. Firstly, the framework of diversity-based cyber defense against malicious attacks is formulated. Secondly, the risk index based on representative attack patterns is constructed, which is the objective to be minimized. Thirdly, considering that the deployment scheme is long-term stable while the operating mode varies with time, we construct a multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming to mitigate the average risk of operating modes. Then the optimization problem is solved by the multiobjective genetic algorithm. Lastly, results of the IEEE 39-node CPPS and and the Virtual European Grid demonstrate that the proposed method can considerably reduce the attack risk.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3086681","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2017YFB0903000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1766203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447199","Cyber-physical power system;multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA);nonlinear integer programming;risk mitigation;stochastic programming;software diversity","Substations;Cyberattack;Software;Power systems;Indexes;Security;Risk management","computer crime;cyber-physical systems;genetic algorithms;nonlinear programming;power engineering computing;power generation protection;power grids;power system security;risk management;software engineering;stochastic programming;substations","diversity-based cyber defense;malicious attacks;risk index;representative attack patterns;attack risk;software deployment;long-term risk mitigation;cyber-physical power systems;wide-area cyber attacks;software diversity;cyber software;zero-day security loophole;substations;multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming;optimization;multiobjective genetic algorithm;IEEE 39-node CPPS;virtual European grid","","1","","38","IEEE","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The video coding community considers this problem in the context of transcoding media streams, but their approaches either fail to address authentication or fail to provide meaningful security guarantees. We present two provably-secure schemes, LISSA and TRESSA, that allow an intelligent network intermediary to intercept a stream signed by a content provider, and adapt it dynamically, while preserving the ultimate receiver's ability to securely verify the content provider's signature (and, hence, authenticity and integrity of the data received). Our schemes allow the intermediary to selectively remove portions of the stream and, thus, permit common media transcoding techniques such as scalable compression and multiple file switching.

Recently, legal regulations have also become effective that require automobile manufacturers to set up a monitoring system for fleet-wide security analysis. The growing amount of software, networking, and the automation of driving create new challenges for security. Context-awareness, situational understanding, adaptive security, and threat intelligence are necessary to cope with these ever-increasing risks. In-vehicle security should be adaptive to secure the car in an infinite number of (driving) situations. For fleet-wide analysis and alert triage, knowledge and understanding of the circumstances are required. Context-awareness, nonetheless, has been sparsely considered in the field of vehicle security. This work aims to be a precursor to context-aware, adaptive and intelligent security for vehicles and fleets.

One of its most valuable features is its threat detection function which is available on every version of the firewall running a software version of 8.0(2) or higher. Threat detection operates at layers 3 and 4 to determine a baseline for network traffic, analysing packet drop statistics and generating threat reports based on traffic patterns. Despite producing a large volume of statistical information relating to several security events, further effort is required to mine and visually report more significant information and conclude the security status of the network. There are several commercial off-the-shelf tools available to undertake this task, however, they are expensive and may require a cloud subscription. Furthermore, if the information transmitted over the network is sensitive or requires confidentiality, the involvement of a third party or a third-party tool may place organisational security at risk. Therefore, this paper presents a fuzzy logic aided intelligent threat detection solution, which is a cost-free, intuitive and comprehensible solution, enhancing and simplifying the threat detection process for all. In particular, it employs a fuzzy reasoning system based on the threat detection statistics, and presents results/threats through a developed dashboard user interface, for ease of understanding for administrators and users. The paper further demonstrates the successful utilisation of a fuzzy reasoning system for selected and prioritised security events in basic threat detection, although it can be extended to encompass more complex situations, such as complete basic threat detection, advanced threat detection, scanning threat detection, and customised feature based threat detection.","","978-1-5090-6020-7","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2018.8491574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491574","","Firewalls (computing);Feature extraction;Fuzzy logic;Tools;Monitoring;Fuzzy reasoning","computer crime;firewalls;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;organisational aspects;user interfaces","organisational networks;valuable features;threat detection function;software version;network traffic;analysing packet drop statistics;traffic patterns;statistical information;significant information;security status;third-party tool;organisational security;fuzzy logic;intelligent threat detection solution;comprehensible solution;threat detection process;fuzzy reasoning system;threat detection statistics;prioritised security events;complete basic threat detection;advanced threat detection;customised feature based threat detection;Cisco adaptive security appliance 5500 series firewall","","15","","28","Crown","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Storing data and performing computations using for example cloud services is commonplace nowadays. However, the information security in network-based computation rarely is satisfactory. One technique to improve information security for networked computations is based on secure multiparty computations. The idea of multiparty computation originates from Yao, who considered the secure computation with two parties by introducing the technique called garbled circuits. The technique was then generalized, but still the exact definitions for different security measures were not established until Bellare, Hoang and Rogaway proposed a definition of a garbling scheme and several security notions for garbling schemes. This gave inspiration to study the security properties of garbling schemes from different perspectives, including adaptivity and reusability. In this paper, we study the adaptive security for a certain type of reusable garbling schemes. First, we consider general constraints to achieve security for this specific type of garbling schemes. Then we analyze the adaptive security classes of reusable garbling schemes. More specifically, we prove a relation between security classes that has been left open in earlier research.","","978-1-4799-6239-6","10.1109/CIT.2014.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984672","secure multiparty computations;garbling schemes;reusability;adaptive security;projectivity","Games;Medical diagnostic imaging;Software;Encryption;Adaptation models;Privacy","computer network security","reusable projective garbling scheme;network-based computation;data storage;cloud service;information security;networked computation;secure multiparty computation;garbled circuits;security measures;security properties;adaptive security","","1","","24","IEEE","15 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, as we show, existing counterexample-guided algorithms can perform poorly if the system model allows configuration changes during execution. Yet disallowing such changes can hide significant problems, such as privilege escalation.

We exploit the innovative idea of Public Physical Unclonable Functions (PPUFs) that fundamentally protects attackers from recovering the secret key from public gate delay information. We implement its hardware logic in a real-world FPGA board. On top of the PPUF fingerprint hardware, we present an adaptive security control mechanism consisting of adaptive key generation and key exchange protocol, which adjusts security strength depending on system load dynamics. We demonstrate that our PPUF FPGA implementation embeds distinctive variability enough to distinguish between two different PPUFs with high fidelity.

The loss of information, denial of access, information leakage, collusion, technical failures, and data security breaches are difficult to predict and anticipate in advance. These types of nonstationarity are one of the main issues in the design of the reliable IoT infrastructure capable of mitigating their consequences. It is not sufficient to propose solutions for a given scenario, but mechanisms to adapt the current solution to changes in the environment. In this article, we present a multicloud storage architecture called WA-MRC-RRNS that combines the weighted access scheme, threshold secret sharing, and redundant residue number system with multiple failure detection/recovery mechanisms and homomorphic ciphers. We provide a theoretical analysis of the probability of information loss, data redundancy, speed of encoding/decoding, and show how to dynamically configure parameters to cope with different objective preferences, workloads, and cloud properties. We propose a multiobjective optimization mechanism to adjust redundancy, encryption-decryption speed, and data loss probability. Comprehensive experimental analysis with real data shows that our approach provides a secure way to mitigate the uncertainty of the use of untrusted and not reliable IoT infrastructure.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2981276","Russian Science Foundation(grant numbers:19-71-10033); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9037363","Multicloud storage;reliability;residue number system;resource management;safety;security","Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Cryptography;Software reliability;Computer architecture","cloud computing;computer network reliability;computer network security;cryptography;data integrity;Internet of Things;optimisation;probability","scalable data storage design;nonstationary IoT environment;internet-of-Things environment;availability violations;information leakage;collusion;technical failures;data security breaches;reliable IoT infrastructure capable;current solution;multicloud storage architecture;WA-MRC-RRNS;weighted access scheme;threshold secret sharing;redundant residue number system;homomorphic ciphers;theoretical analysis;information loss;data redundancy;different objective preferences;multiobjective optimization mechanism;encryption-decryption speed;data loss probability;comprehensive experimental analysis;untrusted IoT infrastructure;not reliable IoT infrastructure","","38","","89","IEEE","16 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This leads to open and outsourcing all or part of their information system (IS) to create collaborative processes by composing business services picked in each partner IS and to take advantage of Cloud computing. Business services outsourcing and their dynamic collaboration context can bring lost of control on IS and new security risks can occur. This leads to inconsistent protection allowing competitors to access to unauthorized information. To address this issue, systematic security service invocations may be added, without paying attention to the business context leading to costly over protection. To address this issue, an adaptive security service model deployment is required to provide a business service consistent protection by taking into account the collaboration context (business service data criticity, partners involved in the collaboration, etc.), and the cloud deployment and execution environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security model based on MDS@run.time, the marriage of Model Driven Security (MDS) and Models@run.time approaches, allowing to select at runtime the appropriate security components to apply. The MDS approach is used to generate security policies, which are interpreted at runtime and load appropriate security mechanisms depending on the context (which takes advantage of the Models@run.time approach) ensuring business process end to end protection. A proof of concept prototype is built on top of the OW2 FraSCAti middleware, validating our proposition efficiency. Our experiments and simulations show that MDS@run.time improves the system efficiency when the over-protection risk rate increases.","","978-1-4799-8356-8","10.1109/SOSE.2015.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133513","","Context;Business;Authentication;Context modeling;Middleware;Collaboration","cloud computing;groupware;information systems;middleware;outsourcing;risk management;security of data;software performance evaluation","service protection optimization;model driven security@run.time;MDS@run.time;collaborative business;information system;business services outsourcing;dynamic collaboration context;cloud computing;security risks;adaptive security service model deployment;business service consistent protection;business service data criticity;cloud deployment;execution environment;Models@run.time;security policy generation;OW2 FraSCAti middleware;system efficiency improvement;over-protection risk rate","","2","","29","IEEE","25 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Streaming refers to downloading software to client hardware platforms for temporary local execution. OS and application software is managed from a centralized server and provided only on-demand. Users obtain a clean, consistent, current build each time they log in, removing the nuisance of security patching and rebooting for environmental changes. Local execution and caching preserves user experience comparable to traditionally installed applications. To explore feasibility, Intel conducted a proof-of-concept (POC) to evaluate streaming in its call center and manufacturing environments on multi-user systems. The four-part study included performance, usability, IT operations and total cost of ownership (TCO). The proof-of-concept was successful in identifying streaming as a feasible technology with good performance and positive TCO in the tested scenarios. The biggest benefits were related to locking down the client and thus eliminating service calls related to configuration changes, software installation and viruses. The major challenges encountered were around the high learning curve and the software maturity related to packing applications for streaming. Based on the strong positive outcome of the POC, Intel has added streaming to its IT roadmaps.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-17-5","10.1109/PICMET.2008.4599691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599691","","Software;Streaming media;Manufacturing;Cities and towns;Africa;Servers;Computational modeling","DP industry","Intel case study;software on demand;software as a service approach;software streaming;proof-of-concept","","","2","","","15 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, initial projects looking at this concept have focussed on the technology for providing multi-mode and software reconfigurable terminals. The Transparently Reconfigurable Ubiquitous Terminal (TRUST) project differs in that it examines the user requirements in order to identify the frameworks and systems that are needed to support software reconfigurable radios from the users' perspective. The primary goal of the TRUST project is to realise the user potential of reconfigurable radio systems, which will provide network connectivity and services when and where they are required. The project will achieve this through a four-step process: (1) understand the users' requirements from their perspective of the system: ""the terminal"" (2) translate these users' requirements into technology requirements (3) advance the terminal and network technologies through research and innovation (4) validate, promote and disseminate these advancements and technologies.","","0-7803-6463-5","10.1109/PIMRC.2000.881582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=881582","","Software radio;Security;Application software;Software standards;FCC;Europe;Laboratories;Educational institutions;Software testing;Economies of scale","land mobile radio;telecommunication terminals;data communication","IST-TRUST;reconfiguration;future mobile terminals;software download;reconfigurable software radio;Transparently Reconfigurable Ubiquitous Terminal;user requirements;software reconfigurable radios;user potential;network connectivity","","14","9","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These architectural configuration changes have affect on the overall system quality attributes (i.e. performance, security and reliability). Therefore, modelling SoS architecture is a challenging task as CSs and the possible architectural configurations are not entirely known at design time.

Different methods for image scaling are presented and their impact on the algorithms are measured. We propose an adaptive scaling mechanism, that implies the selection and dynamic adaptive configuration of one of the available hardware engines (interpolators), in order to optimize the power consumption and the bandwidth used for data transmission. The artificial intelligence processing outputs are used as a source for these configuration changes. Besides the optimal decision on enabling the appropriate re-sampling interpolator, the parameters computed (in order to configure this selected hardware block) are the quality of the scaling and the image resolution. The hardware implementation for this mechanism is presented and the measured results are discussed.

Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks. The proposed system takes into account Multiple Layered Perceptron (MLP) architecture and resilient backpropagation for its training and testing. The system uses sampled data from Kddcup99 dataset, an attack database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection mechanisms.

Cloud servers need to have the confidential information mobile and ready in case of cancellation so that the same user can authenticate or identify using the same authentication process when joining to other clouds. However, a cloud server needs to be careful transferring biometric data to other cloud during busy time, since biometric data is sensitive to bit error rate that may adversely affect the false acceptance or rejection rate. As such another key contribution of this paper is to provide a decision making model for biometric/confidential data transfer among clouds in busy time in order to avoid network congestion. The work presented in this research is also a good fit during migration of today's internet into MobilityFirst architecture while biometric information in a locality is being shared by cloud servers and service is being provided at the same time.","2158-2297","978-1-4673-8644-9","10.1109/ICIEA.2016.7603637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7603637","Cancellable;Biometric;Mobility;Cloud","Cloud computing;Authentication;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Servers;Bioinformatics;Fingerprint recognition","biometrics (access control);cloud computing;error statistics;security of data;software architecture","cancellable multimodal biometric authentication;cloud based MobilityFirst;secure multimodal biometric authentication;cloud servers;bit error rate;Internet;MobilityFirst architecture","","2","","10","IEEE","24 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security is important in data protection so as not to be infringed by unauthorized parties. If the vulnerabilities found are not amended, it leads to cyber-attacks such as Structured Query Language Injection Attack (SQLIA) performed by certain parties which enable them to gain unauthorized data access. To cater security issues, variety of security frameworks for secure software development life cycle (SDLC) were introduced. Secure SDLC is created by integrating security-related activities to an each phase of in used development methodologies such as waterfall model or agile model. However, the application security problem continues to grow. Strict, complicated and heavyweight frameworks are underutilized due to several factors. The factors that influence the implementation of secure SDLC identified in public sector (the scope is State Secretary Offices in Malaysia) are inadequate development timeline, improper development team size and less awareness of team members' workload. It is agreed that integrating security at earlier (requirement and design) phase is the most effective and cheapest way to develop secure web application. Hence, an adaptive secure SDLC model is proposed to integrate security activities using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) focusing on the influence factors as the main criteria and meet the international and local secure frameworks standards. The proposed model will recommend adaptive security activities as a guideline to be applied at earlier phases of SDLC to help eliminate/ minimize the web application vulnerabilities and increase the application security and implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype at selected Malaysian public sector for in-house web application development.","","978-1-5386-6925-9","10.1109/AINS.2018.8631401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8631401","web application;security activities;secure SDLC;in-house web application development;public sector","Security;Software;NIST;Information technology;Testing","analytic hierarchy process;data protection;fuzzy set theory;Internet;security of data;software engineering;SQL","structured query language injection attack;software development life cycle;Malaysian public sector;SQLIA;waterfall model;FAHP;fuzzy analytic hierarchy process;agile model;health organizations;financial organizations;in-house web application development;local secure frameworks standards;international frameworks standards;adaptive secure SDLC model;unauthorized data access;cyber-attacks;data protection","","","","46","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, In-band Network Telemetry (INT) has presented its unique capabilities in acquiring the insights of a network and thus has been adopted in many production networks. However, less attention was put on the potential threats on INT (e.g., the man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojan horse injection) that may falsify network measurements resulting in catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a secure INT architecture called SINT that can effectively mitigate INT vulnerabilities and can be implemented using ‘chiplet’ based multi-modal network processors (MNP). SINT adopts blockchain technology into INT, in which a network status snapshot acquired via INT is viewed as a block and added into a network telemetry blockchain to prevent arbitrary access and malicious modification. To minimize the intrusiveness of the INT and blockchain operations, SINT is designed to be a lightweight protocol and uses improved RAFT consensus mechanisms to reduce its network and computing overhead. The design of the chiplet MNP system makes SINT highly flexible and adaptive to facilitate INT convergence and related blockchain updates. In the SINT architecture, INT tasks and blockchain operations are dispatched to different chips to achieve an optimal trade-off among measurement accuracy, security requirements, and computing resource on the data plane. Experiments and simulations show that SINT can alleviate most cyberattacks on INT and retain 97% of bandwidth utilization for other users’ normal traffic in a complex scenario with 500 nodes. Furthermore, SINT converges the INT results quickly and accurately with minor overhead compared to that of the state-of-art INT methods.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2023.3269891","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1800602); China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M710677); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107633","INT;blockchain;multi-modal network processor;security","Blockchains;Telemetry;Computer architecture;Security;Current measurement;Control systems;Task analysis","blockchains;computer network security;invasive software;security of data;telemetry","blockchain operations;blockchain technology;blockchain-based;chiplet based multimodal network processors;In-Band Network Telemetry Architecture;INT convergence;INT results;INT tasks;INT vulnerabilities;managed network;network management;network measurements;network status snapshot;network telemetry blockchain;production networks;related blockchain updates;secure INT architecture;SINT architecture;state-of-art INT methods","","","","50","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Threat modeling allows for a by-design approach, mitigating problems before they arise and avoiding later costly development efforts. However, it mainly pays off in software construction approaches that rely on planned architectures, in which sources of threats can be anticipated beforehand. These axiomatic assumptions are, however, increasingly untrue in contemporary software development practices in which software systems evolve drastically in later stages. In addition, software-intensive systems are increasingly faced with uncertainty in their operational contexts, and these are nearly impossible to enumerate in early development stages. In this article, we first present the idea of reflective threat modeling, which involves the automated derivation of architectural system models from run-time and operational system artifacts, providing the threat modeler with an accurate and workable run-time inspection view of the system. We then outline and motivate the potential of adopting threat analysis models as a basis for holistic and adaptive threat management through integration of adaptive security and privacy technologies.

In distributed real-time embedded applications, e.g., electric grid management and command and control applications, it is required to not only meet real-time constraints but also support the data confidentiality,integrity, and authenticity. Unfortunately, in general, cryptographic functions are computationally expensive, possibly causing deadline misses in real-time embedded systems with limited resources. As a basis for cost-effective security support in real-time embedded systems, we define a quantitative notion of Strength of Defense (SoD). Based on the SoD concept, we propose a novel adaptive security policy in which the SoD can be degraded by decreasing the cryptographic key length for certain tasks, if necessary, to improve the success ratio under overload conditions. Our approach is lightweight. The time complexity of our approach is linear and its amortized version has the constant overhead per SoD adaptation period. Moreover, our approach supports desirable security features requiring an attacker to do extra work to find the cryptographic key. In the performance evaluation, we show that our approach can considerably improve the success ratio due to controlled SoD degradation under overload.","2325-1301","0-7695-2676-4","10.1109/RTCSA.2006.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1691312","","Real time systems;Embedded system;Cryptography;Embedded computing;Degradation;Power system security;Computer science;Application software;Control systems;Intelligent networks","computational complexity;cryptography;data integrity;embedded systems;message authentication;scheduling","distributed real-time embedded system;data confidentiality;data integrity;data authenticity;cryptographic key;cost-effective adaptive security policy;strength of defense concept;time complexity","","5","1","22","IEEE","11 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal is to reduce the latency of emergency services for vehicles such as ambulances and police cars, with minimum unnecessary disruption to the regular traffic, and preventing potential misuses. To this end, we propose to design a framework in which the Traffic Management System (TMS) may adapt by dynamically adjusting traffic lights, changing related driving policies, recommending behavior change to drivers, and applying essential security controls.

Making a right decision in each and every situation is one of the most challenging aspects of engineering self-protecting software systems. Inspired by the game theory, in this research work, we model the interactions between the attacker and the adaptation manager as a two-player zero-sum Markov game. Using this game-theoretic approach, the adaptation manager can refine its strategies in dynamic attack scenarios by utilizing what has learned from the system's and adversary's actions. We also present how this approach can be fitted to the well-known MAPE-K architecture model. As a proof of concept, this research conducts a study on a case of dynamic application-layer denial of service attacks.

Approaches based on manually written rules are often fragile and require constant maintenance in this era of continuous integration. In this paper, we propose a novel “discovery by example” approach to autonomously search for and identify system changes. Our approach learns characteristic features of system changes automatically, without requiring any explicit rule definitions or specific knowledge of the underlying software or systems. In this approach, given a system change, our method searches a repository that contains previous stored system changes and returns those that are similar to it. We further explore the use of various forms of “fingerprints” to represent system changes efficiently and faithfully in a compact manner. We propose and evaluate two types of fingerprints: the “basename fingerprint” and the “1-D histogram fingerprint”. We show that both fingerprints exhibit different efficiency and accuracy trade-offs, and they can be effectively employed in different use cases.

Achieving these goals would require software development, management, and operation platforms that support elasticity, diversity, awareness, cooperation, and intelligence. In this paper, we propose CyberX, a situation-aware trustworthy management platform. CyberX utilizes our Cell Oriented Architecture (COA) capability that separates the main design concerns: data, logic and physical resources to employ runtime diversity via hot shuffling of similar-function different-quality-objective code variants. CyberX employs such diversity to modify the application implicit behavior at runtime utilizing autonomous execution elasticity and adaptability. Further, CyberX enhances application resilience against failures and attacks via multi-mode recovery and real-time, context- and situation-aware adjustment of shuffling and recovery policies.

However, due to the relatively low sampling rate, μPMU has not yet been used to detect and classify cyber-attacks in power electronics enabled smart grid. To our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to use μPMU to detect cyber attacks that degrade the performance of power electronics systems.

Given the trend toward interconnecting OT and IT networks for business reasons, and given the disclosure of highly sophisticated attacks against OT environments, OT network operators increasingly recognize the need to deploy security solutions that are widely known in IT also to OT. OT networks are running critical control processes. Configuration changes are avoided to reduce the risk of misconfiguration or unforeseeable side effects detrimental to the network's operation. Therefore, passive non-intrusive security technologies are favored. Consequently, security intelligence applied to passively collected network data is the most acceptable technology to be deployed in OT networks. In this paper, we show how IT-specific security intelligence techniques can be applied to passively collected OT network data.

The basic principle of the scheduling algorithm is detected to increase the chance of mimicry escape. This paper designs a dynamic scheduling mechanism with diversified algorithms, which increases the complexity and dynamics of the scheduling mechanism, and can effectively reduce the risk of the scheduler being sniffed.

Many counterfeits can be identified once installed, however even a tech-savvy user may struggle to detect them before installation as app icons and descriptions can be quite similar to the original app. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage the recent advances in deep learning methods to create image and text embeddings so that counterfeit apps can be efficiently identified when they are submitted to be published in app markets. We show that for the problem of counterfeit detection, a novel approach of combining content embeddings and style embeddings (given by the Gram matrix of CNN feature maps) outperforms the baseline methods for image similarity such as SIFT, SURF, LATCH, and various image hashing methods. We first evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two well-known datasets for evaluating image similarity methods and show that, content, style, and combined embeddings increase precision@k and recall@k by 10-15 percent and 12-25 percent, respectively when retrieving five nearest neighbours. Second specifically for the app counterfeit detection problem, combined content and style embeddings achieve 12 and 14 percent increase in precision@k and recall@k, respectively compared to the baseline methods. We also show that adding text embeddings further increases the performance by 5 and 6 percent in terms of precision@k and recall@k, respectively when $k$k is five. Third, we present an analysis of approximately 1.2 million apps from Google Play Store and identify a set of potential counterfeits for top-10,000 popular apps. Under a conservative assumption, we were able to find 2,040 potential counterfeits that contain malware in a set of 49,608 apps that showed high similarity to one of the top-10,000 popular apps in Google Play Store.

Therefore, management of these devices is becoming increasingly important to network operators. Existing network monitoring technologies perform traffic analysis using specialized acceleration on network switches, or full inspection of packets in software, which can be complex, expensive, inflexible, and unscalable. In this paper, we use SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs, classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks).","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.2971213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8981946","IoT;device monitoring;flow characteristics;machine learning","Monitoring;Telemetry;Performance evaluation;Object recognition;Machine learning;Cameras;Internet of Things","computer network security;firmware;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic;telemetry","nonIoTs;real traffic traces;IoT cyber-security;cyber-security risks;Internet of Things devices;network operators;network monitoring technologies;network switches;programmable flow-based telemetry;flexible data-driven models;network activity;traffic flows;network behavior;real consumer IoT devices;flow-level attributes;SDN paradigm;machine learning;time-series attributes;firmware upgrade;cyber attacks","","38","","57","IEEE","4 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This requires an adaptation quality metric that captures (1) an application's susceptibility to cyber attacks and (2) an application's functionality, since adapting an application affects both of these factors. FUZZBUSTER uses different types of test cases to measure security and functionality. In this paper, we describe FUZZBUSTER's adaptation metrics and we present two different policies for balancing security and functionality.

The key solution to achieve this goal is to integrate multiple avionic systems, apply new signal processing and RF capabilities. A generalized and reconfigurable architecture of Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) with integrated and modularised structure based on Direct RF Sampling (DRFS) and Software Defined Radio (SDR) is presented in this paper for avionic applications. The proposed architecture is composed of a DRFS digital receiver integrated within a SDR software modules. DRFS technology is adopted in the digital receiver, which consists of Pre-selection Filters and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to provide flexible compatibility for diverse modulation modes and various RF/IF frequency bands. By employing the concept of DRFS/SDR, distinct procedures for different avionic purposes, such as Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing System (ILS), can be achieved in the same hardware platform. Notably, this proposed architecture has the potential to be reconfigured and improved in several ways without any hardware change to accommodate new features and signal capabilities. As per experimental validation phase, an MMR integrated system for VOR and ILS receivers has been designed and implemented. Test results have illustrated that the implementation feasibility of multi-mode DRFS avionic receivers is beneficial and efficient using the proposed architecture. Moreover, the benefits obtained from this new approach are not only covering miniaturization, lightweight, and low power consumption but is also promising to overreach the equivalent commercial systems in the future.","2375-5318","978-1-4673-8823-8","10.1109/RADAR.2017.7944467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7944467","Avionic;DRFS;SDR;MMR;IMA;VHF;VOR;ILS","Aerospace electronics;Receivers;Radio frequency;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Band-pass filters;Mixers","avionics;instrument landing systems;radio receivers;software radio","direct RF sampling;avionic systems;VOR;ILS receiver;aerospace industry;avionic architecture;cost reduction;weight reduction;maintenance complexity;RF efficiency;signal processing;generalized architecture;reconfigurable architecture;multimode receiver;MMR;integrated structure;modularised structure;software defined radio;SDR;DRFS digital receiver;SDR software modules;pre-selection filters;field programmable gate arrays;FPGA;flexible compatibility;diverse modulation modes;RF-IF frequency bands;very-high-frequency omnidirectional range;instrument landing system;hardware platform;MMR integrated system;multimode DRFS avionic receivers;power consumption","","6","","16","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It consists of a forward-based fence comprised of a mixture of selected low cost, low power, netted sensors including a simple radar, acoustic microphone array and optical (infrared and visible) cameras to detect, track and discriminate potential airborne targets. An experimental prototype end-to-end proof of concept system with deploy able software, hardware and connectivity is built using COTS component. Multi-modal senor fusion algorithms employing Kalman filter for target tracking and acoustic and image recognition algorithm for target classification are implemented. Results from field tests reveal reasonable detection and discrimination among candidate aircraft.","","1-4244-1052-5","10.1109/THS.2007.370049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4227812","","Prototypes;Multimodal sensors;Sensor arrays;Military aircraft;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Optical sensors;Infrared sensors;Laser radar;Radar tracking;Microphone arrays","acoustic microscopes;acoustic signal detection;aircraft;cameras;image classification;Kalman filters;national security;object-oriented programming;search radar;sensor fusion;target tracking;terrorism","multimodal netted sensor fence;homeland defense;border integrity;terrorists;airborne threats;civilian targets;military targets;low-flying airborne vehicles;fixed-wing aircraft;unmanned aerial vehicles;chemical attacks;biological attacks;nuclear attacks;drugs smuggling;illegal immigrants;24/7 sentry functions;critical infrastructure surveillance;joint multisensor fusion technology;forward-based fence;radar;acoustic microphone array;optical infrared cameras;optical visible cameras;COTS component;Kalman filter;target tracking;acoustic recognition;image recognition;target classification","","3","","5","IEEE","11 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a distributed approach to multi-robot exploration which always keeps all the robots in communication range. The algorithm is based on a utility function that guarantees communication while using best effort for the exploration itself. The robots randomly sample configuration changes of the overall system, i.e., the set of the next best joined movements based on this utility function. This process can be very well distributed with very few communication overhead by having each robot computing a part of the sample and broadcasting its best candidate configuration change found. The globally best candidate among the broadcasted ones is then executed by the team.

It allows us to auto control electronic appliances in the house such as fans, lights, gates, doors, windows, and many more including security access systems and alarm systems. In this paper, we have implemented the operation of lights through the voice-controlled home automation system by giving voice commands as an input to the system for the user to turn ON and turn OFF the lights at home. The system mainly uses the Raspberry Pi module, which happens to be an important component of our smart light system implementation. It consists of both hardware and software components, which have a speech recognition module implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has voice commands that can be understood, and accordingly, lights can be operated with its usage. It has a special feature that when the light gets turned ON or OFF, it will be ensured to the user through an audio output by the speaker. The main working of a voice-automated system depends on the recognition of the voice given by the user as an input. Raspberry Pi module keeps all electrical home appliances connected through a single interface for complete smart home system automation. Today's modern world is shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems with less human intervention, as result, the use of manual operating switches is slowly deteriorating. In this paper, we have used voice recognition for operating the home appliances where there is no need to use the conventional switches, and hence human effort required for the system is comparatively very less. Research work on smart home systems mainly aims to satisfy the needs, which help elderly and disabled people etc. in operating home appliances without any helping support from others.

In this paper, we propose a new framework, SWIFT, that automatically generates test packets with network configurations. SWIFT minimizes the number of test packets by allowing a packet to go through multiple links or interfaces. For network updates, SWIFT updates test packets in an incremental way to revalidate the network. We evaluate its performance using hundreds of benchmark network configurations. The results show that it takes few seconds to generate test packets to exercise all links and interfaces, and updates the test packets in few seconds for configuration changes.

First of all, two PV systems with a different number of PV inverters and power ratings are analyzed and their attack models are studied. Next, an attack detection Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was trained with rich amount of data from PV #1. Then, transfer learning was proposed to transfer the well-trained features from PV #1 to PV #2. Lastly, the attack detection model on PV #2 was trained based on the transferred CNN model.

Such devices will however be broadly used only if they are ""prescribed"" by the hospitals as a part of a therapy and are reimbursed by the insurances. For this we need the proof of their safety, medical efficacy and economic efficiency. Aside of obligatory clinical trials we need an extensive system of post-market surveillance, because: a medical device is a part of a complex cyber-physical system, with humans in the loop / the environment cannot be sufficiently defined / humans react differently to the therapy, they also behave differently / after every software upgrade the device is not the same as before In their operation such devices generate huge amounts of data that can be reused for such analysis. Technically oriented people believe it can be done using a Big Data Analytics system without a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. It is doubtful if such approach can deliver useful results. The main problems seem to be: unbalanced cohort / various patient groups with various preferences / multiple quality parameters (basic algorithm, signal propagation, battery, security & privacy, obtrusiveness, etc.) / multiple variants (operating modes, device settings) / variability of the device and of the environment. When we transform data into ""actionable knowledge"", especially if the generated decisions influence human health, utmost care has to be applied.

Unlike cookies, fingerprinting is a stateless technique that does not store any information on devices, but instead exploits unique combinations of attributes handed over freely by browsers. The uniqueness of fingerprints allows them to be used for identification. However, browser fingerprints change over time and the effectiveness of tracking users over longer durations has not been properly addressed. In this paper, we show that browser fingerprints tend to change frequently-from every few hours to days-due to, for example, software updates or configuration changes. Yet, despite these frequent changes, we show that browser fingerprints can still be linked, thus enabling long-term tracking. FP-STALKER is an approach to link browser fingerprint evolutions. It compares fingerprints to determine if they originate from the same browser. We created two variants of FP-STALKER, a rule-based variant that is faster, and a hybrid variant that exploits machine learning to boost accuracy. To evaluate FP-STALKER, we conduct an empirical study using 98,598 fingerprints we collected from 1, 905 distinct browser instances.

According to the WHO, good health is not only about zero sicknesses or disability but is also about physical well-being, sound mental state and social and spiritual welfare. The technological implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health has vast potential for personalizing treatment selection, prognostication, and relapse monitoring. Moreover, it provides remedies to reduce stress and anxiety for situations that do not require immediate and necessary medical intrusion and emergency contacts and services in case of a severe condition. Particularly, to discern depressive behaviours, multi-modal data is used to examine and exploit a large variety of parameters. Unlike the usual method of having an observational study that is done by taking surveys or questionnaires, the AI model helps us to understand and explore the inconspicuous and reliable detection of depressive symptoms obtained from visual and vocal features of the user. In today's time, vocalizing one's concerns regarding their mental health must be normalized. As humans, it is normal to feel different emotions at once. The application is free and anonymous to make the users feel empowered and safe in seeking treatment. Mental health is all about how an individual thinks, feels and copes up with events in their life.","","978-1-6654-2577-3","10.1109/ICONAT53423.2022.9726090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9726090","ChatBot;RASA;Convolutional Neural Network;Mental Health","Visualization;Sociology;Neural networks;Mental health;Speech recognition;Depression;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;emotion recognition;health care;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical information systems;patient treatment;public domain software;security of data","medical health;mental health;sound mental state;spiritual welfare;human emotion detection;medical intrusion;social welfare;artificial intelligence;AI;stress reduction;anxiety reduction;emergency contacts;emergency services;CNN;RASA;personalizing treatment selection;prognostication;relapse monitoring","","1","","20","IEEE","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such methodology may no longer be sufficient and appropriate for investigating the performance of state-of-the-art systems. This paper addresses this gap by establishing taxonomy of biometric systems and proposing a baseline methodology that can be applied to the majority of contemporary biometric systems to obtain an all-inclusive description of their performance.

These machines now affect the safety of humans as well as the security of personal data and consequently money transactions. To ensure the integrity of these systems' operating state, several fault detection mechanisms have been developed to safely correct or stop unforeseen execution behavior. Because of the rise of battery or even field-supplied systems these mechanisms often heavily decrease available power budgets or lead to significantly increased production costs. Therefore, this paper introduces novel micro-architectural execution signature characterization and handling techniques for system-on-chip designs providing power estimation hardware. Existing power sensor infrastructure is reused to enable efficient system-state monitoring using micro-architectural hashes to cover a wide range of implemented system functionality. Reduced hashing implementations are characterized for their fault detection efficiency. This hardware-based approach provides a completely transparent solution to counteract faults resulting from emerging wearout defects or intentional attacks on the execution integrity.","1558-1780","978-1-4673-0697-3","10.1109/ETS.2012.6233011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6233011","","Hardware;Monitoring;Fault detection;Estimation;System-on-a-chip;Software;Process control","fault diagnosis;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;multiprocessing systems;system-on-chip","low-cost micro-architectural signature;MPSoC;micro-architectural execution signature characterization technique;micro-architectural execution signature handling technique;system-on-chip design;power estimation hardware;power sensor infrastructure;system-state monitoring;micro-architectural hash;hashing implementation;fault detection efficiency;wearout defect","","4","1","22","IEEE","9 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments. Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM, designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and waiver-granted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADS-B, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network. Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and non-compliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS. The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we will present our experimental design and current test data from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM, and GA shared airspace research.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-0649-6","10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9081710","fail-safe;fail-secure;UAS;UTM;UAM;GPS;ADS-B","","aerospace computing;air traffic control;aircraft navigation;autonomous aerial vehicles;cloud computing;control engineering computing;data mining;Global Positioning System;inertial navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;sensor fusion","inertial navigation systems;security threats;safe sUAS-UAM shared airspace;secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace;passive visual sensor nodes;acoustic sensor nodes;air traffic control;acoustic arrays;urban UAS operating region;Class-D airspace;Drone Net approach;ground radar;Drone Net network;fail-secure property;ground sensor network;ground-system sensor fusion;UTM flight plan;fail-secure methods;multiple UAS;regional cloud-based networks;multisensor drone detection;Drone Net project;global cloud-based networks;UAS traffic management network;fail-safe experiments;ADS-B;GPS;Global Positioning System;UAM airspace;UAM vehicles;heterogeneous drone shapes;innovative aviation designs;air taxi service;urban air mobility;unmanned aerial systems;urban airspace;UAM traffic;fail-secure experiments;flight instruments;airspace safety;flight sensor network","","7","","43","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multimedia has become the biggest of big data as the foundation of today's data-driven discoveries. Almost all disciplines of science and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data in some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security surveillance. Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-time broadcast of unfolding events on social networks. Multimedia data is not just big in volume, but also multi-modal and mostly unstructured. Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, and recognizing from the vast amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. Even though significant progress has been made processing multimedia data, today's solutions are inadequate in handling data from millions of sources simultaneously. The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (IEEE-MIPR) aims to provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation, and applications of multimedia information processing and retrieval for single modality or multiple modalities. The target audiences are university researchers, scientists, industry practitioners, software engineers, and graduate students who want to become acquainted with technologies for big data analytics, machine intelligence, information fusion in multimedia information processing and retrieval. Following a successful debut in Miami, Florida in 2018, the second MIPR, held in San Jose, California, attracted over 140 submissions and more than 100 attendees—a big growth from its inaugural event and an indication of its growing visibility and popularity in the multimedia research society.

The algorithm relies on the comparison of the incremental losses brought by the addition of each and every load to the network. Quadratic and linear relationships between load currents and paths form the basis of the decisions made for the connections.
