It also goes without saying that this approach to computing shares its own challenges the most echoed being security. Security concerns herein, birthed by the exposure of the cloud to different threats, continue to cast doubts on potential users and it's only befitting that such concerns are addressed. Users who entrust their data to the cloud want their data to be secured in the strongest terms possible. Once data leaves the user, the onus is on the cloud provider to provide the required security since data now lies within their perimeter of jurisdiction. But security requirements do change with time and this therefore calls for a continuous process of evaluating the security status of the cloud system. This paper proposes a model of analyzing the security status of the cloud system with regards confidentiality, integrity and availability. We employ state transitions of a conceptual finite state machine, Boolean algebra and logic to evaluate the various states of the system when a specified breach occurs. The scope of this paper is limited to user data on the cloud and not as it traverses the network between the user and the provider.","","978-1-4673-8515-2","10.1109/CCI.2016.7778962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778962","cloud computing;threats;state transitions;Boolean logic","Cloud computing;Security;Computational modeling;Analytical models;NIST;Software as a service","Boolean algebra;cloud computing;finite state machines;security of data","integrated state transition-Boolean logic model;security analysis;cloud computing;security requirements;security status evaluation;cloud system;confidentiality;integrity;availability;conceptual finite state machine;Boolean algebra","","","","20","IEEE","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The recent articles indicate that Ormon PLCs used Fins Ethernet protocol were exposed to mode-switching malicious network attack. However, the traditional detection methods based on function codes and Snort detection rules could not get an ideal result. In this paper, we propose a method that can overcome these problems in dealing with mode-switching attack by an external hash authentication device embedding asymmetric encryption.

Fins protocol as one of the most popular protocols is built into a larger number of Ormon devices that are used in different kinds of measurement, and control systems and has been targeted as the desirable candidate for cyber-attack. However, the traditional detection method based on traffic analysis and function code compliance detection is unable to detect mode-switching attack that is consistent with the protocol syntax, and it is a very harmful network attack against industrial devices.

In this work, we propose a novel application of a key-based obfuscation technique to achieve security against hardware Trojans. The obfuscation scheme is based on modifying the state transition function of a given circuit by expanding its reachable state space and enabling it to operate in two distinct modes - the normal mode and the obfuscated mode. Such a modification obfuscates the rareness of the internal circuit nodes, thus making it difficult for an adversary to insert hard-to-detect Trojans. It also makes some inserted Trojans benign by making them activate only in the obfuscated mode. The combined effect leads to higher Trojan detectability and higher level of protection against such attack. Simulation results for a set of benchmark circuits show that the scheme is capable of achieving high levels of security at modest design overhead.","1558-2434","978-1-60558-800-1","10.1145/1687399.1687424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361306","Design obfuscation;hardware security;hardware Trojan","Hardware;Information security;Protection;National security;State-space methods;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Permission;Computational modeling;Logic design","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;invasive software;monolithic integrated circuits;national security;safety-critical software","security;malicious hardware Trojan;design obfuscation;safety-critical applications;state transition function;reachable state space;internal circuit nodes","","68","2","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stateful network protocols have complex communication interactions and state transitions. However, the existing network protocol fuzzing does not support state transitions very well. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes the Semi-valid Fuzzing for the Stateful Network Protocol (SFSNP). The SFSNP analyzes protocol interactions and builds an extended finite state machine with a path marker for the network protocol; then it obtains test sequences of the extended finite state machine, and further performs the mutation operation using the semi-valid algorithm for each state transition in the test sequences; finally, it obtains fuzzing sequences. Moreover, because different test sequences may have the same state transitions, the SFSNP uses the state transition marking algorithm to reduce redundant test cases. By using the stateful rule tree of the protocol, the SFSNP extracts the constraints in the protocol specifications to construct semi-valid fuzz testing cases within the sub-protocol domain, and finally forms fuzzing sequences. Experimental results indicate that the SFSNP is reasonably effective at reducing the quantity of generated test cases and improving the quality of fuzz testing cases. The SFSNP can reduce redundancy and shorten testing time.","1007-0214","","10.23919/TST.2017.8030535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8030535","network protocol fuzzing; extended finite state machine; test sequence; state transition markingalgorithm; semi-valid algorithm","Testing;Security;Software;Trajectory;Transport protocols;Redundancy","computer network security;finite state machines;fuzzy set theory;program testing;transport protocols","SFSNP analyzes protocol interactions;extended finite state machine;test sequences;semivalid algorithm;state transition;stateful rule tree;protocol specifications;semivalid fuzz testing cases;Stateful Network Protocol;Semivalid Fuzzing;subprotocol domain;network protocol fuzzing","","2","","","","11 Sep 2017","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

In this paper we present guidelines to assist architecture evaluation activities in REST-based systems. These guidelines can be systematically used in conjunction with scenario-based evaluation methods to reason about design considerations and trade-offs.

Despite of the convenience in collecting information to provide the decision basis for the users, the vulnerability of embedded sensor nodes in multimedia devices makes the malware propagation a growing serious problem, which would harm the security of devices and their users financially and physically in wireless multimedia system (WMS). Therefore, many researches related to the malware propagation and suppression have been proposed to protect the topology and system security of wireless multimedia network. In these studies, the epidemic model is of great significance to the analysis of malware propagation. Considering the cloud and state transition of sensor nodes, a cloud-assisted model for malware detection and the dynamic differential game against malware propagation are proposed in this paper. Firstly, a SVM based malware detection model is constructed with the data sharing at the security platform in the cloud. Then the number of malware-infected nodes with physical infectivity to susceptible nodes is calculated precisely based on the attributes of WMS transmission. Then the state transition among WMS devices is defined by the modified epidemic model. Furthermore, a dynamic differential game and target cost function are successively derived for the Nash equilibrium between malware and WMS system. On this basis, a saddle-point malware detection and suppression algorithm is presented depending on the modified epidemic model and the computation of optimal strategies. Numerical results and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm can increase the utility of WMS efficiently and effectively.","1673-5447","","10.1109/CC.2018.8300282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8300282","Internet of Things;wireless multimedia system;state transition;malware propagation;differential game","Malware;Cloud computing;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Multimedia communication","cloud computing;computer network security;game theory;Internet of Things;invasive software;multimedia communication;radiocommunication;topology","Internet of Things;malware suppression framework;cloud-assisted malware detection;saddle-point malware detection;modified epidemic model;WMS devices;malware-infected nodes;SVM based malware detection;state transition;wireless multimedia network;system security;topology;malware propagation;multimedia devices;embedded sensor nodes;dynamic network service infrastructure;dynamic differential game;IoT;wireless multimedia system","","19","","","","21 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Multipath execution is designed and implemented to achieve not only randomness of memory layout and diversity of binary files, but also randomness of program code paths executed, which is unique in our work.

In the second part of the paper, we use a discrete event dynamic system model of security dynamics. We show how to derive events and transitions from existing security taxonomies. We then apply theory of discrete event control to define safety properties of the computer system in terms of the basic concepts of controllability used in discrete event control for two special sublanguages K/sub s/ and K/sub v/. These languages correspond to maximally robust controllable sub-languages. In the third approach, we show that by associating cost with the state transitions, the security quantification problem can be casted as Markov decision problem (MDP).

Various security solutions have been proposed and implemented to protect users' data from unknown threats. Majority of these solutions are realized employing traditional networking techniques that are complex and extremely difficult to manage. These techniques rely on manual configuration of devices resulting in policy conflicts, which may compromise the network security. This issue can be addressed by adopting Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm which provides a network-wide visibility, centralized control, flexible network architecture and ease of management, by separating control plane (network controller) and the data plane (forwarding devices). The controller monitors, manages and controls the behaviour of the forwarding devices using OpenFlow protocol.

However, many of these solutions stop at triggering the security measure and give little thought to amending it. As a consequence, once the violation is addressed, no clear path exists for reinstating the flagged client beyond having the network operator reset the controller or manually implement a state change via an external command.

We propose Global Access Control, an extended access control mechanism enabling a uniform expression of heterogeneous security information. Mappings from existing Mandatory and Discretionary Access Controls are described. To permit the control of data aggregation, the derivation of unauthorized information from authorized data, our security framework provides a logic-based language, the Federated Logic Language (FELL), which can describe constraints on both single and multiple states of the federation. To enforce constraints, FELL statements are mapped to state transition graphs which model the different subcomputations required to check the aggregation constraints. Graph aggregation operations are proposed for building compound state transition graphs for complex constraints. To monitor aggregation constraints, two marking techniques, called Linear Marking Technique and Zigzag Marking Technique, are proposed. Finally, we describe a three-layer DOK logical secure architecture enabling the implementation of the different security agents. This includes a Coordination layer, a Task layer, and a Database layer. Each contains specialized agents that enforce a different part of the federated security policy.

But most of those attempts consider SDN security from the OpenFlow perspective. To the best of our knowledge, none so far has paid attention to the security analysis and modeling of Forwarding and Control planes Separation Network Structure (FCSNS) in SDN. Therefore, this paper provides a different approach to network security based on Petri net and Attack tree models. Our objective is to analyze the FCSNS security via the combination of model and state. This method represents the network structure and state transferring by way of Petri net. In addition, it introduces the security analysis method of STRIDE to build up the Attack tree model. Finally, we analyze FCSNS via the combination of Petri net and Attack tree model and present the results. Our results are very promising in using such models to achieve such security objectives.","","978-1-4673-8579-4","10.1109/ICCNC.2016.7440631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7440631","Control;Forward;Separation;Petri net;Attack tree;OpenFlow;SDN","Switches;Security;Petri nets;Analytical models;Data communication;Network topology","Petri nets;software defined networking;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics)","network security;Petri net;attack tree;software defined networks;SDN;OpenFlow perspective;forwarding and control planes separation network structure;FCSNS security","","8","","18","IEEE","24 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software that heavily interacts with the underlying OS (e.g., I/O intensive and event-driven applications) suffers from system call overhead. To deteriorate this situation, security vulnerabilities in modern processors have prompted kernel mitigations that further increase the transition overhead. Particularly system-call-heavy applications have been reported to be slowed down by up to 30% with kernel page-table isolation (KPTI), the widely deployed mitigation for the Meltdown vulnerability. To decouple system calls from mode transitions, we revisit an old idea known as system-call batching or multi-calls: the bundling of system calls into a combined call, which only incurs the mode-transition costs of a single one. And then, we have implemented ESCA scheme to adapt system-call batching to Linux-based servers in the light of Meltdown and Spectre, effectively eliminating the slowdown of KPTI-affected applications. Our evaluation shows that the throughputs of real-world applications, benefiting from ESCA, can be improved with only 2 lines of code changed respectively: Nginx by up to 12%, lighttpd by up to 23%, and Redis by 4%.

State transition analysis is a new approach to representing computer penetrations. In STAT, a penetration is identified as a sequence of state changes that take the computer system from some initial state to a target compromised state. The development of the first USTAT prototype, which is for SunOS 4.1.1, is discussed. USTAT makes use of the audit trails that are collected by the C2 basic security module of SunOS, and it keeps track of only those critical actions that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration.

However, it is less efficient to fuzz the stateful protocols due to the difficulties like maintaining states and dependencies of messages. To address these challenges, we present SPFuzz, a framework for building flexible, coverage-guided stateful protocol fuzzing. We define a language in SPFuzz to describe the protocol specifications, protocol states transitions and dependencies for generating valuable test cases, maintaining correct messages in session states and handling protocol dependencies by updating message data in time. The SPFuzz adopts a three-level mutation strategy, namely head, content, and sequence mutation strategy to drive the fuzzing process to cover more paths, in conjunction with the method to randomly assign weights to messages and strategies. We use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of SPFuzz and other frameworks upon three protocol implementations, i.e., Proftpd, Oftpd, and OpenSSL, which are three-granularity coverages specifically function, basic block, and edge. In experiments, the SPFuzz framework outperforms the existing stateful protocol fuzzing tool Boofuzz by an average of 69.12% in three granularities coverage tests. This demonstrates that the SPFuzz has the ability to explore more and deeper paths of the target program. We further triggered CVE-2015-0291 in OpenSSL 1.0.2 with the SPFuzz, which proves the validity and utility of our framework.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2895025","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0200401); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; National High-level Personnel for Defense Technology Program(grant numbers:2017-JCJQ-ZQ-013); HUNAN Province Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017RS3045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8626141","AFL;coverage;fuzzing;network protocol;software security","Protocols;Fuzzing;Tools;Servers;Security;Schedules;Engines","program testing;protocols;telecommunication scheduling","hierarchical scheduling framework;stateful network protocol fuzzing;fuzzing technology;coverage improvement;target program;coverage-guided stateful protocol fuzzing;protocol specifications;protocol states transitions;correct messages;session states;handling protocol dependencies;message data;three-level mutation strategy;sequence mutation strategy;fuzzing process;protocol implementations;SPFuzz framework;granularities coverage tests;stateful protocol fuzzing tool Boofuzz","","14","","37","OAPA","25 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, existing software and even hardware approaches for finding and identifying memory bugs have considerable performance overheads, target only a narrow class of bugs, are costly to implement, or use computational resources inefficiently. This paper describes MemTracker, a new hardware support mechanism that can be configured to perform different kinds of memory access monitoring tasks. MemTracker associates each word of data in memory with a few bits of state, and uses a programmable state transition table to react to different events that can affect this state. The number of state bits per word, the events to which MemTracker reacts, and the transition table are all fully programmable. MemTracker's rich set of states, events, and transitions can be used to implement different monitoring and debugging checkers with minimal performance overheads, even when frequent state updates are needed. To evaluate MemTracker, we map three different checkers onto it, as well as a checker that combines all three. For the most demanding (combined) checker, we observe performance overheads of only 2.7% on average and 4.8% worst-case on SPEC 2000 applications. Such low overheads allow continuous (always-on) use of MemTracker-enabled checkers even in production runs","2378-203X","1-4244-0804-0","10.1109/HPCA.2007.346205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147668","","Monitoring;Computer bugs;Hardware;Software debugging;Security;Software tools;Buffer overflow;Memory management;Software performance;Application software","checkpointing;program debugging;software metrics;storage management;system monitoring","MemTracker;memory access monitoring;memory access debugging;software complexity;programmable state transition table;monitoring checker;debugging checker","","81","2","24","IEEE","10 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a key-based security through obscurity approach for protecting RTL hardware IPs. The RTL design is first transformed into a technology-independent gate-level description and the functionality of the resulting gate-level netlist is then changed through modification of its state transition function. This process allows normal operation only on the successful application of a correct initialization sequence. The modified gate-level design is then decompiled to generate an obfuscated version of the RTL. Major RTL constructs and macros are optionally preserved through the transformation process using a forward annotation file. The proposed methodology differs from existing hardware obfuscation as well as watermarking techniques in its ability to achieve simultaneous functional and semantic obfuscation for RTL description of IP at low design overhead. Simulation results for a set of open-source IP cores show that we can achieve high levels of security through a well-formulated obfuscation scheme incurring nominal area, delay and power overhead.","","978-1-4244-4805-0","10.1109/HST.2009.5224963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5224963","Hardware IP Protection;IP piracy;RTL obfuscation","Protection;Watermarking;Cryptography;Open source software;Reverse engineering;Hardware design languages;Design methodology;Computer security;Registers;System-on-a-chip","industrial property;integrated circuit design;reverse engineering;security of data;system-on-chip;watermarking","system-on-chip designs;register transfer level hardware IP;bug-free hardware intellectual property cores;IP piracy;reverse engineering;register transfer level description;key-based security;technology-independent gate-level description;watermarking techniques;correct initialization sequence","","23","4","13","IEEE","28 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It thus provides immunity from attacks that target specific OS vulnerabilities while eliminating the OS overhead in a conventional system. We describe a novel implementation of TLS that runs on a bare PC. The TLS implementation differs from a conventional TLS implementation in that it is included within a bare PC application that manages its own CPU tasks, directly interfaces to the hardware, and communicates with network protocols without using a standard socket interface. Furthermore, the unique software architecture of a bare PC enables the TLS, TCP, and application protocols to be intertwined, thereby reducing the communication overhead compared to that of a conventional system. As an example, we give details of the internal architecture of a bare PC TLS Web server. We then illustrate intertwining of the TLS, TCP, and HTTP protocols. In particular, we show how a state transition model that represents events and actions in the TLS Web server is used to develop the intertwined protocol code. We also discuss the testing methodology, note some challenges with respect to implementing TLS on a bare PC, and outline the measures taken to address them.","","978-0-7695-4043-6","10.1109/ICCRD.2010.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5489544","Bare PC;Application Object (AO);protocol intertwining;Transport Layer Security(TLS);Web server","Protocols;Operating systems;Application software;Web server;Computer applications;Hardware;Communication standards;Sockets;Software architecture;Computer architecture","computer network security;network servers;operating systems (computers);software architecture;transport protocols","TLS protocol;operating system;bare PC;network protocol;software architecture;TCP;intertwined protocol code;Web server;transport layer security","","7","","14","IEEE","21 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the attacks become more variable and complex, there is an urgent need for dynamic defense methods. In this paper, we propose a security function virtualization (SFV) based moving target defense of SDSG which makes the attack surface constantly changing. First, we design a dynamic defense mechanism by migrating virtual security function (VSF) instances as the traffic state changes. The centralized SDN controller is re-designed for global status monitoring and migration management. Moreover, we formalize the VSF instances migration problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem with multiple constraints and design a pre-migration algorithm to prevent VSF instances' resources from being exhausted.

Hardware design obfuscation is a promising countermeasure to resist reverse engineering attacks and IP piracy. The majority of existing hardware obfuscation methods modify the original finite state machine (FSM) by adding additional state transitions and utilizing a key sequence to lock the transition from the nonfunctional states to the functional reset state. Those methods are effective to prevent attackers from entering the normal functional mode but they lack resilience if the FSM is already in the normal mode. This paper proposes to protect all the states with a low-cost state-deflection-based obfuscation method, which dynamically deflects state transitions from the original transition path to a black hole cluster if a wrong key is applied. Unlike other works that use static transitions between legal states to black hole states at the design time, this method utilizes a state rotation function (Rotatefunc) and selective register flipping function (Mapfunc) to dynamically control the state deflection paths. Hence, the difficulty of reverse engineering and thwarting register overwrite attacks is increased. Simulations performed on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show that the proposed method significantly reduces the difference of the net toggle activities between the correct and wrong key scenarios, and achieves up to 56% higher code coverage than the most efficient obfuscation method. Thanks to the dynamic deflection feature, on average, this method generates about 100 more unique state register patterns than other methods with moderate power increase. Moreover, the proposed method achieves the Hamming distance of primary outputs and state registers close to 50%.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2017.2697960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7911190","Design obfuscation;gate-level netlist;hardware security;intellectual property (IP) piracy;reverse engineering;state deflection","Registers;Hardware;IP networks;Security;Hamming distance;Logic gates;Reverse engineering","finite state machines;flip-flops;integrated circuit design;invasive software","novel dynamic state-deflection method;gate-level design;emerging security threats;integrated circuit supply chain;chip integrity;hardware intellectual property piracy;hardware design obfuscation;reverse engineering attacks;hardware obfuscation methods;original finite state machine;FSM;key sequence;nonfunctional states;functional reset state;normal functional mode;low-cost state-deflection;original transition path;black hole cluster;static transitions;legal states;black hole states;design time;state deflection paths;dynamic deflection feature;primary outputs;state transitions;benchmark circuits;selective register flipping function;unique state register patterns;register overwrite attacks;state rotation function","","45","","29","IEEE","25 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By collecting the status of each switch through the Southbound, SDN provides a global view for the controller to attain flexible packet forwarding by a proactive mode or a reactive mode. However, a proactive mode is not suitable for highly dynamic networks and reactive mode needs to take a while termed as control delay from the collection state to the start of schedule. In large-scale and dynamic networks, control delay can cause network congestion when the network state changes more severely with high loads. In this paper, an M/D/1 queuing model is proposed to analyze the influence of this control delay, and then deep learning methods combining the advantages of proactive mode and reactive mode are adopted to predict the traffic to manage the traffic routing in advance. To reduce the prediction inaccuracy caused by the randomness and suddenness of traffic, we modify the loss function in deep learning models considering the time correlation and spatial correlation of traffic sequences and this proposed method has the potential to effectively reduce the predicted root mean square error (RMSE) by over 30%. Next, according to the predicted results, we propose a method of adjusting routing paths in advance in SDN to balance the load of overlapping links. Finally, simulation results show that using a deep learning method with a modified loss function can effectively reduce the average end-to-end delay by over 10% under a high load.","2769-3899","979-8-3503-1125-9","10.1109/ICPS58381.2023.10128099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128099","Software-Defined Networking (SDN);deep learning;traffic prediction","Deep learning;Analytical models;Correlation;Switches;Predictive models;Control systems;Routing","computer network security;deep learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;queueing theory;software defined networking;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","average end-to-end delay;collection state;control delay;data planes;deep learning method;deep learning models;flexible packet forwarding;highly dynamic networks;modified loss function;network congestion;network control;network state changes;optimize routing paths;predicted root mean square error;prediction inaccuracy;proactive mode;reactive mode;SDN;Software-Defined Networking;traffic prediction;traffic routing;traffic sequences","","","","22","IEEE","24 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DPI aims to identify various malware (including spam and viruses) by inspecting both the header and the payload of each packet and comparing it to a known set of patterns. DPI is often performed on the critical path of the packet processing, thus the overall performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of DPI. The seminal algorithm of Aho-Corasick (AC) is the de facto standard for pattern matching in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Basically, the AC algorithm constructs a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) for detecting all occurrences of a given set of patterns by processing the input in a single pass. The input is inspected symbol by symbol (usually each symbol is a byte), such that each symbol results in a state transition. Thus, in principle, the AC algorithm has deterministic performance, which does not depend on specific input and therefore is not vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks, making it very attractive to NIDS systems. In this paper we show that, when implementing the AC algorithm in software, this property does not hold, due to the fact that contemporary pattern sets induce very large DFAs that cannot be stored entirely in cache. We then propose a novel technique to compress the representation of the Aho-Corasick automaton, so it can fit in modern cache. We compare both the performance and the memory footprint of our technique to previously-proposed implementation, under various settings and pattern sets. Our results reveal the space-time tradeoffs of DPI. Specifically, we show that our compression technique reduces the memory footprint of the best prior-art algorithm by approximately 60%, while achieving comparable throughput.","2325-5560","978-1-4244-8456-0","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5985996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5985996","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Software algorithms;Encoding;Pattern matching;Software;Throughput","authorisation;computer networks;Internet","software-based deep;space-time tradeoffs;packet inspection;network intrusion detection;prevention systems;Web application firewalls;DPI;packet processing;deterministic finite automaton;state transition;algorithmic complexity attacks;NIDS systems;AC algorithm;Aho-Corasick automaton;compression technique","","14","2","25","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems are commonly used for the security purposes but are increasingly being used in a variety of other applications such as residential security, voter verification, banking using ATM. Changes in facial expression become a difficult task in recognizing faces. In this paper continuous naturalistic affective expressions will be recognized using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. Active Appearance Model (AAM) landmarks are considered for each frame of the videos. The AAMs were used to track the face and extract its visual features. There are six different facial expressions considered over here: Happy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Fear and Sad. Different Expression recognition problem is solved through a multistage automatic pattern recognition system where the temporal relationships are modeled through the HMM framework. Dimension levels (i.e., labels) can be defined as the hidden states sequences in the HMM framework. Then the probabilities of these hidden states and their state transitions can be accurately computed from the labels of the training set. Through a three stage classification approach, the output of a first-stage classification is used as observation sequences for a second stage classification, modeled as a HMM-based framework. The k-NN will be used for the first stage classification. A third classification stage, a decision fusion tool, is then used to boost overall performance.","","978-1-4799-2320-5","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892800","Hidden Markov model (HMM);K Nearest Neighbor (k-NN);Active Appearance Model (AAM);Dimension levels","Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Face recognition;Speech recognition;Active appearance model;Support vector machine classification;Speech","biometrics (access control);face recognition;hidden Markov models","hidden states;state transitions;AAM landmarks;active appearance model;HMM framework;ATM;banking;voter verification;residential security;digital image;biometric software application;Hidden Markov Model;automatic human facial expression recognition","","5","","23","IEEE","8 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to low-resource and poor computing capability, these devices have a high number of firmware vulnerabilities. Software verification is a powerful solution to ensure the correctness and security of IoT firmware programs. Unfortunately, due to the complex semantics and syntax of program languages (typically C), applying software verification in IoT firmware faces the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. One of the fundamental reasons is that verification methods cannot support verifying state transitions on the memory space caused by pointer operations well. To this end, by combining sparse value flow (SVF) analysis into model checking and optimizing computational redundancy among them, we design a novel points-to-sensitive model checker, called PCHECKER, which can provide a highly precise and efficient verification for IoT firmware programs. We first design a spatial flow model to effectively describe state behaviors of a C program both on the symbolic and memory space. We then propose a counterexample-guided model checking algorithm that can dynamically refine abstract precisions and update nondeterministic points-to relations. With a set of C benchmarks containing a variety of pointer operations and other complex C features, our experiments have shown that compared with state of the art (SOTA), PCHECKER can achieve outstanding results in the verification tasks of C programs that its verification accuracy is 95.9%, and its average verification time of each line of code is 1.27 ms, which are both better than existing model checkers.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3163383","Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2022JQ-611); Basic Research Programs of Taicang(grant numbers:TC2020JC03); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515110279); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:D5000210588); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745051","Model checking;pointer analysis;spare value flow analysis;software verification","Model checking;Computational modeling;Software;Internet of Things;Analytical models;Semantics;Security","C language;firmware;Internet of Things;program verification;storage management","C program;firmware vulnerabilities;software verification;IoT firmware programs;complex semantics;program languages;pointer operations;sparse value flow analysis;spatial flow model;nondeterministic points-to relations;state transition verification;points-to-sensitive model checker;counterexample-guided model checking;Internet of Things;memory space;SVF;computational redundancy;PCHECKER","","","","45","IEEE","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Delay-on-Miss technique is one such approach, which simply delays loads that miss in the L1 cache until they become non-speculative, resulting in no transient changes in the memory hierarchy. However, this costs performance, prompting the use of value prediction (VP) to regain some of the delay.However, the problem cannot be solved by simply introducing a new kind of speculation (value prediction). Value-predicted loads have to be validated, which cannot be commenced until the load becomes non-speculative. Thus, value-predicted loads occupy the same amount of precious core resources (e.g., reorder buffer entries) as Delay-on-Miss. The end result is that VP only yields marginal benefits over Delay-on-Miss.In this paper, our insight is that we can achieve the same goal as VP (increasing performance by providing the value of loads that miss) without incurring its negative side-effect (delaying the release of precious resources), if we can safely, non-speculatively, recompute a value in isolation (without being seen from the outside), so that we do not expose any information by transferring such a value via the memory hierarchy. Value Recomputation, which trades computation for data transfer was previously proposed in an entirely different context: to reduce energy-expensive data transfers in the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of value recomputation in relation to the Delay-on-Miss approach of hiding speculation, discuss the trade-offs, and show that we can achieve the same level of security, reaching 93% of the unsecured baseline performance (5% higher than Delay-on-miss), and exceeding (by 3%) what even an oracular (100% accuracy and coverage) value predictor could do.","","978-1-6654-2025-9","10.1109/SEED51797.2021.00021","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604354","security;microarchitecture;recomputation;speculation","Microarchitecture;Costs;Side-channel attacks;Data transfer;Software;Delays;Security","cache storage;computer architecture;cryptography","value recomputation;speculative side-channel attacks;microarchitectural state changes;Delay-on-Miss technique;memory hierarchy;value prediction;VP;value-predicted loads;invisible speculation performance;L1 cache","","","","51","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many open source software solutions available in cloud to handle huge amount of digital data. However none of these solutions addresses all the requirements needed to manage the content spread out in multiple systems effectively. The user has to relay on multiple content management systems to do the work. This turns into ever more unwieldy, time consuming and leads to loss of data. Using robust and integrated content management systems, these issues could be solved effectively. In this paper we have identified various challenges of using the content management system in the cloud after surveying many Content Management System related article and proposed an integrated solution named Cloud based Architecture integrating Content Management System which is capable of interfacing with various unique features available at different content management system installations in the cloud. This maximizes the functionality and performance of any Content management systems. The Representational State Transfer (REST) protocol is used to integrate the best features of various open source content management systems. REST provides higher level of security compared to existing systems as it does not store the user sessions. The users can interact with the system with the help of an interface which abstracts the complexities of multiple content management systems running in the cloud.","","978-1-5090-5960-7","10.1109/ICIMIA.2017.7975631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975631","CMS;Open Source;Cloud;REST;PhP;MYSQL;Web Services","Content management;Cloud computing;Security;Organizations;Tools;Computer architecture","cloud computing;content management;data handling;public domain software;security of data","cloud based architecture;digital content;distributed cloud environment;open source software;digital data handling;Representational State Transfer protocol;REST protocol;open source content management systems;security","","","","15","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different from previous approaches where DSU is described from the viewpoint of program's internal state transitions, our framework focuses on program's external behavior and its effect on its environment. This more abstract view avoids over specification of DSU and allows for better DSU flexibility.

By introducing the maximum entropy (MaxENT) models into the rule optimization for the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model, this paper proposes an improved BLP model with the self-learning function: MaxENT-BLP. This model first formalizes the security properties, system states, transformational rules, and a constraint model based on the states transition of the MaxENT. After handling the historical system access logs as the original data sets, this model extracts the user requests, current states, and decisions to act as the feature vectors. Second, we use k -fold cross validation to divide all vectors into a training set and a testing set. In this paper, the model training process is based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. And this model contains a strategy update algorithm to adjust the access control rules dynamically according to the access and decision records in a system. Third, we prove that MaxENT-BLP is secure through theoretical analysis. By estimating the precision, recall, and F1-score, the experiments show the availability and accuracy of this model. Finally, this paper provides the process of model training based on deep learning and discussions regarding adversarial samples from the malware classifiers.

However, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the wireless interface through jamming prevents the secondary control system from performing its main tasks, which might compromise the stability of the MG. In this paper, we propose novel, robust and secure secondary control reconfiguration strategy, tailored to counteract DoS attacks. Specifically, upon detecting the impairment of the wireless interface, the jammed secondary control agent notifies its peers via a secure, low-rate powerline channel based on Power Talk communication. This triggers reconfiguration of the wireless communication graph through primary control mode switching, where the jammed agents leave the secondary control by switching to current source mode, and are replaced by non-jammed current sources that switch to voltage source mode and join the secondary control. The strategy fits within the software-defined networking framework, where the network control is split from the data plane using reliable and secure side power talk communication channel, created via software modification of the MG primary control loops.

Among all the consequences of this globalization trend, the possible existence of stealthy-inserted hardware Trojans (HTs) has raised a great security concern. Without the awareness of the end users or the original designers of host circuits, HTs are usually inserted stealthily at one of the outsourced design or fabrication stages, remain (almost) harmless to the host on dormant mode, and upon triggered will disturb the functions and/or leak the secrets carried by the host. It could become a serious security leak of the systems built on top of infected chips. Identifying whether a circuit carries an HT is thus of the utmost importance to mission-critical applications. Speaking from the point of HT designers, nets with extreme state probabilities could be used to create rare state combination for the purpose of HT triggering. Besides, HT designers seek nets with low switching probabilities to insert their HTs in order not to increase power leakage. We denote the nets with extreme state probability as extreme nets and the nets with low switching probability as inactive nets. It is commonly believed that in order to minimize the chance of accidental triggering or power analysis, they would be better to choose, among all the nets of the host, the nets that with extreme state probabilities (extreme nets) or the nets that barely switch (inactive nets) to construct the trigger parts of their HTs, respectively. However, a net of a circuit experiences very different state probabilities and switching probabilities on test mode and function mode, and existing works have only considered the former. The nets with low activeness on both test mode and function mode hence will be the “best candidates.” In this paper we will first build the ground on finding the nets with low activeness on function mode, and then propose a fast heuristic method approach. The method runs in minimal complexity, has high accuracy, and is tested on popular benchmarks and large-sized circuits.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2017.2753201","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:106112016CDJZR185512); NSFC(grant numbers:61772092); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8039222","Hardware Trojan (HT);nets activeness;state transition;total state","Switches;Hardware;Fabrication;Registers;Trojan horses;Globalization;Market research","integrated circuit design;invasive software;microprocessor chips","potential trigger detection;stealthy-inserted hardware Trojans;HT designers;extreme state probability;HT triggering;low switching probability;accidental triggering power analysis;function mode;IC industry;serious security leak;mission-critical applications;rare state combination;heuristic method approach;large-sized circuits","","11","","23","IEEE","18 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Coordinated evolution of the various elements of a decentralized system may be difficult, if not impossible, as individual organizations evolve their service offerings in response to organization- and service-specific pressures, including market demand, technology, competitive and cooperative interests, and funding. Consequently, decentralized services offer unique challenges for evolution and adaptation that reach well beyond any one single organizational boundary. However, client-driven service customization and tailoring is a powerful tool for meeting conflicting, independent client demands in an environment where disorderly and uneven service evolution predominates. To this end, we contribute an architectural style, COmputAtional State Transfer (COAST), designed to provide extensive, safe, and secure client-directed customization of decentralized services. COAST combines mechanisms from software architecture, cryptography, security, and programming languages, granting application architects flexible provisioning of their core services and assets while protecting those services and assets from attack and misuse.","","978-1-4673-2809-8","10.1109/WICSA-ECSA.212.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337763","software architecture;decentralized systems;service-oriented architectures;client-driven adaptation","Security;Mobile communication;Engines;Semantics;Organizations;Computer architecture;Context","cloud computing;cryptography;customer services;organisational aspects;programming languages;service-oriented architecture","COAST;decentralized on-demand tailored services;software architectural style;systems-of-systems;organization-specific pressures;service-specific pressures;market demand;funding;organizational boundary;client-driven service customization;client-driven service tailoring;client demands;computational state transfer;cryptography;programming languages;security features;competitive interests;cooperative interests","","4","","52","IEEE","25 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The evolutionary properties of viruses are taken into account in the model by the formal rule that previously immunized or cured nodes, at some interval (the size of which is the model parameter), can be re-infected, and exposure of antivirus protection has a lag time (also is a model parameter). In this model, it was accepted that any network node could be in one of three states: in a protected (immunized) state; in an infected state; in a neutral state. In a neutral state, the node may be infected or immunized. In an immunized state, the node can send out antiviruses, which cures infected and immunizes neutral nodes. In this state, copies of antiviruses (useful viruses) are sent out to the nodes of the network randomly chosen (random choice in the address space indicates of the stochastic behavior). In an infected state, the node can send out copies of viruses to nodes in the network, also by randomly selecting in the address space (this also shows the stochastic behavior). The stochastic dynamics model of the spread of evolving viruses in the computer network was described graphically using a diagram of possible transitions between nodes states which allow one to create a system of kinetic differential equations describing these processes. One of the advantages of the model being developed is the ability to modify and expand it by creating more complex state change graphs and transitions between them. This provides supplementing the system of kinetic equations with a member that considers the overall increasing in the number of users and devices in computer networks over time that can be described by a function of any kind.","","978-1-7281-6700-8","10.1109/CSCMP45713.2019.8976837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976837","evolving computer viruses;virus outbreaks dynamics;lag times;logistic growth","","computer network security;differential equations;graph theory;invasive software;microorganisms;stochastic processes","neutral nodes;stochastic behavior;infected state;stochastic dynamics model;evolving viruses;computer network;transitions;dynamic model;stochastic spread;immunized cured nodes;antivirus protection;network node;immunized state;computer networks;kinetic differential equations;state change graphs","","","","17","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

TBAS is based on the simple idea of comparing the channel states embedded in packets received within a short interval and discarding the packets if the channel state change is above a reasonable level for the interval. We leverage the packet transmission policies in Wi-Fi to actively elicit packets for the channel state check without modifying the Wi-Fi protocol, such as sending a dummy data packet which will automatically elicit an acknowledgement packet. Comparing to the existing methods that wait passively for the packets from the packet sender for the channel state information, TBAS has the full control of time to collect the channel state, such that it can use stricter rules to classify the packets and achieve higher security. We solve key problems in TBAS, including a Channel State Check (CSC) procedure which determines if two packets are from the same sender, as well as a simple protocol wrapped around CSC to reduce the overhead. We implement TBAS on the Sora software defined ratio and our trace-driven emulations show that TBAS can achieve desirable False Positive and False Negative ratios with very low overhead.","","978-1-5090-1732-4","10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7733021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7733021","","Probes;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Physical layer;Authentication;Protocols;OFDM;History","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","time bounded anti-spoofing;TBAS;spoof detection method;Wi-Fi networks;channel states;channel state change;packet transmission policies;dummy data packet;acknowledgement packet;channel state information;channel state check procedure;CSC procedure;Sora software defined ratio;trace-driven emulations;false positive ratios;false negative ratios","","6","","20","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main purpose of this framework is to maintain good speed scalability and power efficiency over the number of processor cores under severe hardware restrictions for embedded use. Key to the speed scalability is reduction of a communication overhead with parallelized tasks. A data-categorization scheme enables small-overhead cache-coherency maintenance by using directives and instructions from the compiler. In this scheme, the number of cache-flushing time is minimized and parallelized tasks are quickly synchronized by using flags in local memory. As regards power efficiency, to reduce power consumption, power supply to processor cores waiting for other cores is timely and frequently cut off, even in the middle of an application, by using a timely-power- gating scheme. In this scheme, to achieve quick mode transition between ""NORMAL"" mode and ""RESUME POWEROFF"" mode, register values of the processor core are stored in core-local memory, which is active even in ""RESUME POWEROFF"" mode and can be accessed in one or two clock cycles. Measured speed and power of an application show good speed scalability in execution time and high power efficiency, simultaneously. In the case of a secure AAC-LC encoding program, execution speed when eight processor cores are used can be increased by 4.85 times compared to that of sequential execution. Moreover, power consumption under the same condition can be reduced by 51.0% by parallelizing and timely-power gating. The time for mode transition is less than 20 micro seconds, which is only 2.5% of the ""RESUME POWER-OFF"" period.","2332-5690","978-1-4244-4961-3","10.1109/ICPP.2009.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362472","power-gating;low-power;parallelization","Multicore processing;Scalability;Resumes;Energy consumption;Hardware;Synchronization;Power supplies;Registers;Clocks;Power measurement","cache storage;multiprocessing programs;program compilers;security of data;software maintenance;system-on-chip","green multicore-SoC software-execution;timely-power-gating scheme;octo-core chip multiprocessor;automatic multigrain-parallelizing compiler;OSCAR;data-categorization scheme;cache-coherency maintenance;secure AAC-LC encoding program","","1","","20","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Trojans activated by digital logic have gained extensive attention. However, those with analog trigger component remain as a serious issue such as the A2 Trojan. Existing defense against A2 Trojans mainly relies on runtime detection mechanism which needs large monitor hardware overhead and complicated identification/handling software. To address these limitations, this article proposes a built-in structure to accelerate the activation of A2 Trojans, which consists of several composite-logic ring oscillators and a multiple-purpose controller. In addition, two post-fabrication detection schemes named time-division mode-switching (TDMS) and scan-based fault test compatible (SFTC) are proposed. TDMS detection scheme can discover A2 Trojans when running functional patterns by inserting oscillating operations every other cycle.

To use SCR effectively for critical applications, automated verification of safety properties is important. The fact that model checking approaches are sometimes problematic motivates us to further examine the alternative approach of theorem proving. Theorem proving, in general, is a difficult task; however the regular structure of the proof obligations generated from SCR specifications suggests that relatively unsophisticated theorem provers can discharge many of these obligations. As a feasibility study, we use the B-Toolkit to detect safety violations in an example SCR specification. The B-Toolkit is a good choice because it is commercially available and Supports verified refinement to executables in a commercial programming language (C). We convert the mode transition table in the example SCR specification to an AMN (Abstract Machine Notation) specification and analyze the result with the B-Toolkit. The B-Toolkit generates 120 proof obligations of which 113 are automatically discharged by the theorem prover. The remaining 7 proof obligations are, in fact, not theorems and correspond to the 3 problems in the SCR specification detected by the model checking approaches. For the corrected SCR specification, the B-Toolkit automatically discharges all proof obligations. The example shows that even simple theorem provers are a viable approach to automated analysis for SCR specifications.","","0-7803-3979-7","10.1109/CMPASS.1997.613186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=613186","","Safety;Thyristors;Application software;Software systems;Costs;Logic;Systems engineering and theory;Computer languages;Software tools;Security","formal specification;software tools;theorem proving","B-toolkit;SCR specifications;event-driven systems;Software Cost Reduction;specifications;theorem proving;safety violations;Abstract Machine Notation","","","","27","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We model the spread of malware as two functions: the communicability function $f$(x) and the susceptibility function 9 (x). We describe the characteristics of these two function in the CBTC complex network by using the percolation theory. Then we use a perturbation formalism to analyze the impact of malware attack on information flow and use it as an indicator of the cyber layer state. The CBTC cyber-physical system resilience metric formalizes as the system state transitions in three-dimensional state space. The three dimensions respectively represent the cyber layer state, the physical layer state, and the transmission layer state. The simulation results reveal that the proposed framework can effectively assess the resilience of the CBTC system.

A dedicated algorithm is developed to simulate the dynamic profile of the cascading failures, with consideration of the effect of power overloading, malware contagion and interdependency between the power grid and cyber network. Stimulation results on two test cases show that the dynamic profile of the cascading failures in the coupled system displays a “staircase-like” pattern, which can be interpreted as a combined feature of the typical step propagation profile triggered repeatedly by cyber attacks due to network coupling.

However, there are certain attacks like ARP spoofing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error message based attacks etc. for which passive monitoring schemes have several limitations because in such attacks there is no change in sequence of events. IDSs with active probing are now being proposed for such attacks which involve sending of probe packets that cause difference in sequence of events under attack condition and can be then detected using passive monitoring.

While it adopts shared protection to save backup capacity, resource sharing has not been sufficiently explored as each middlebox can only use one backup server. This paper presents a backup allocation model in which a function can be protected by two backup servers and a backup server can protect multiple functions under a shared protection strategy to minimize the maximum unavailability among functions. We use Markov chains to analyze the state transitions and make equilibrium-state equations. By solving them, we obtain the probability of each state of the allocation and compute an unavailability of function. We introduce two algorithms to examine the proposed model; one of them uses the performance bound of the maximum unavailability which is analyzed in this paper.

Further, we obtain the dynamic equations of the transition between nodes and the calculation formula of node availability. The simulation result is that when the degree of node is small and the node vulnerability function is a power function, the node availability is the highest; when the degree of node is large and the node vulnerability function satisfies the exponential function and the power function, the node availability is high. Therefore, when constructing a NBIOT-HWSNs network, node protection is implemented according to the degree of node, so that when the node vulnerability function satisfies the power function, all nodes can maintain high availability, thus making the entire network more stable.","","978-1-7281-0120-0","10.1109/ICSAI.2018.8599320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599320","Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks;NB-IoT;malware;node availability","Wireless sensor networks;Security;Mathematical model;Malware;Mobile communication;Markov processes;Monitoring","Internet of Things;invasive software;Markov processes;wireless sensor networks","node protection;node availability;node state transition model;vulnerability differences;node distribution;node heterogeneity model;NB-IoT;heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;nodes availability analysis;power function;node vulnerability function","","","","18","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, branch predictors are leveraged to trigger mis-speculation in transient execution attacks. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of speculation-based attacks that targets the branch prediction unit (BPU). We find that speculative resolution of conditional branches (i.e., in nested speculation) alter the states of pattern history table (PHT) in modern processors, which are not restored after the corresponding branches are later squashed. Such characteristic allows attackers to exploit the BPU as the secret transmitting medium in transient execution attacks. To evaluate the discovered vulnerability, we build a novel attack framework, BranchSpectre, that enables exfiltration of unintended secrets through observing speculative PHT updates (in the form of covert and side channels). We further investigate the PHT collision mechanism in the history-based predictor and the branch prediction mode transitions in Intel processors. Built upon such knowledge, we implement an ultra-high speed covert channel (BranchSpectre-cc) as well as two side channels (i.e., BranchSpectre-v1 and BranchSpectre-v2) that merely rely on BPU for mis-speculation trigger and secret inference in the speculative domain. Notably, BranchSpectre side channels can take advantage of much simpler code patterns than those used in Spectre attacks.

All these attacks are centered around a common set of behaviors: During speculative execution, the architectural state of the system is kept unmodified, until the speculation can be verified. In the event that a misspeculation occurs, then anything that can affect the architectural state is reverted (squashed) and re-executed correctly. However, the same is not true for the microarchitectural state. Normally invisible to the user, changes to the microarchitectural state can be observed through various side-channels, with timing differences caused by the memory hierarchy being one of the most common and easy to exploit. The speculative side-channels can then be exploited to perform attacks that can bypass software and hardware checks in order to leak information. These attacks, out of which the most infamous are perhaps Spectre and Meltdown, have led to a frantic search for solutions. In this work, we present our own solution for reducing the microarchitectural state-changes caused by speculative execution in the memory hierarchy. It is based on the observation that if we only allow accesses that hit in the L1 data cache to proceed, then we can easily hide any microarchitectural changes until after the speculation has been verified. At the same time, we propose to prevent stalls by value predicting the loads that miss in the L1. Value prediction, though speculative, constitutes an invisible form of speculation, not seen outside the core. We evaluate our solution and show that we can prevent observable microarchitectural changes in the memory hierarchy while keeping the performance and energy costs at 11% and 7%, respectively. In comparison, the current state of the art solution, InvisiSpec, incurs a 46% performance loss and a 51% energy increase.","2575-713X","978-1-4503-6669-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8980347","speculative execution;side-channel attacks;caches","","cache storage;computer architecture;cryptography;microprocessor chips","invisible speculative execution;high-performance general-purpose CPUs;microarchitectural state-changes;speculative side-channels;architectural state;security attacks;memory hierarchy;value prediction","","","","62","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the complexity of rule-sets increases, traditional string matching engines are being replaced by more sophisticated regular expression engines. To keep up with line rates, deal with denial of service attacks and provide predictable resource provisioning, the design of such engines must allow examining payload traffic at several gigabits per second and provide worst case speed guarantees. While regular expression matching using deterministic finite automata (DFA) is a well studied problem in theory, its implementation either in software or specialized hardware is complicated by prohibitive memory requirements. This is especially true for DFAs representing complex regular expressions present in practical rule-sets. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to drastically reduce the DFA memory requirement and still provide worst-case speed guarantees. Specifically, we merge several ""non-equivalent"" states in a DFA by introducing labels on their input and output transitions. We then propose a data structure to represent the merged states and the transition labels. We show that, with very few assumptions about the original DFA, such a transformation results in significant compression in the DFA representation. We have implemented a state merging and transition labeling algorithm for DFAs, and show that for Snort and Bro security rule-sets, state merging results in memory reductions of an order of magnitude.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215710","","Merging;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Pattern matching;Intrusion detection;Computer crime;Payloads;Automata;Hardware;Data structures","finite automata;search problems;security of data;telecommunication security","memory-efficient regular expression search;state merging;pattern matching;critical network services;intrusion detection;policy management;rule-sets;string matching engines;regular expression engines;line rates;denial of service attacks;resource provisioning;payload traffic;regular expression matching;deterministic finite automata;DFA memory requirement;non-equivalent states;data structure;merged states;transition labels;transition labeling algorithm","","83","3","18","IEEE","29 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By decoupling NFs from physical devices, network function virtualization enables virtual network functions (VNF) to run in virtual machines (VMs). However, VNFs are vulnerable to various faults such as software and hardware failures. To enhance VNF fault tolerance, the deployment of backup VNFs in stand-by VM instances is necessary. In case of stateful VNFs, stand-by instances require constant state updates from active instances during its operation. This will guarantee a correct and seamless handover from failed instances to stand-by instances after failures. Nevertheless, such state updates to stand-by instances could consume significant network bandwidth resources and lead to potential admission failures for VNF requests. In this paper, we study the fault-tolerant VNF placement problem with the optimization objective of admitting as many requests as possible. In particular, the VNF placement of active/stand-by instances, the request routing paths to active instances, and state transfer paths to stand-by instances are jointly considered. We devise an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve this problem, and propose a bicriteria approximation algorithm with performance guarantees for a special case of the problem. Simulations with realistic settings show that our algorithms can significantly improve the request admission rate compared to conventional approaches.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-3180-5","10.1109/ICC.2018.8422444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8422444","","Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Delays;Bandwidth;Routing;Software;Approximation algorithms","computer network security;fault tolerance;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication network routing;virtual machines;virtualisation","stand-by VM instances;fault-tolerant VNF placement problem;state transfer paths;fault-tolerant placement;stateful virtualized network functions;network function virtualization;virtual network functions;virtual machines;hardware failures;VNF fault tolerance","","19","","21","IEEE","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detecting such bugs is difficult as they usually result in silent erroneous effect. Prior work on RFC-directed inconsistency bug detection usually deal with a certain protocol or ad-hoc properties in RFCs. In this paper, we present RIBDetector, an approach focusing on statically and efficiently locating inconsistency bugs that could be triggered by hand-crafted network packets in protocol implementations. Given an implementation, its corresponding RFCs and a user-provided configuration file, our approach automatically extracts rules about packet format, state transition and error handling from RFCs into a uniform format which dictates condition checks that must be performed before taking particular operations. Then we leverage common programming conventions to identify corresponding locations of the conditions and operations in implementations and use a light-weight predominator-based algorithm to detect violations of RFC rules. We implemented a prototype of RIBDetector and demonstrated its efficacy by applying it on 14 implementations of 5 network protocols. For implementations varying in size from 1.5 to 141.3 KLOC, RIBDetector consumes 17.57 seconds on average to finish its analysis.

As a consequence, the system maintains an equivalent degree of system availability without requiring more replicas than a traditional replication system. Furthermore, having the old replica available on the same physical host as the rejuvenated replica helps to optimize state transfer.

Prior works have shown that traffic attributes such as packet size combined with machine learning techniques enable the inference of private information from Internet of Things users. One of the commonly used techniques to mitigate those privacy threats is traffic obfuscation, such as packet padding. Most padding mechanisms that were previously proposed statically select the number of bytes inserted in the packets, which incurs high overhead and ineffective privacy improvement. These static mechanisms are particularly unsuitable for networks whose traffic patterns are significantly dynamic, such as smart homes. This article proposes an adaptive packet padding approach based on software-defined networking (SDN) that adjusts the number of bytes inserted into packets in response to variations in the home network utilization. The proposed technique monitors the network to instruct a padding mechanism through a representational state transfer (REST) interface proposed in this article. This mechanism ensures that the length of packets generated by connected devices is modified. The evaluation includes four supervised learning mechanisms, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and k-nearest neighbors (KNNs), to measure privacy improvement through the metrics accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Goodput, jitter, and packet loss induced by the proposal are also evaluated.

As a result, when the inter-domain routing system faces security incidents such as disasters and attacks, it is easy to cause the continuous propagation of link failures, resulting in a large-scale network disconnection and posing a considerable threat to the security of the Internet. The previous research mainly aims to enhance the protocol's safety, cannot change the original failure propagation mechanism, and cannot fundamentally solve cascading failure propagation. In response to this problem, this paper introduces SDN and proposes RSM-PA. This method perceives the available path topology by sharing the link state information in the region, provides a verification mechanism for the availability of the route in the routing process to avoid the link failure in the region due to overload. The comparison of routing results before and after the link state changes under the same experimental conditions shows that RSM-PA can effectively adjust the routing strategy according to the path availability, and lay a solid foundation for suppressing the propagation of cascading failures.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00075","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502528,61402525); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781081","Inter-domain Routing System;Software-defined Networking;Route Selection","Network topology;Heuristic algorithms;Power system protection;Routing;Real-time systems;Routing protocols;Internet","computer network security;routing protocols;software defined networking;telecommunication network topology","route selection method;inter-domain routing system;path availability;routing selection process;link failure;original failure propagation mechanism;link state information;routing process;link state;routing strategy;RSM-PA","","","","22","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since they contain sensitive information, whole collected data should be stored in a platform that guarantee both data confidentiality and integrity. In this sense, permissioned blockchain i.e. Hyperledger can be seen as an auspicious candidate for providing a secure yet scalable storage platform thanks to its data integrity and peers decentralization features. Considering that both IoT and blockchain network have different working mechanism, therefore, a software platform is required to provide an integration layer between the IoT and blockchain network. In this paper, we propose the design of IoT-to-Blockchain platform for integrating internet of things based smart healthcare system and blockchain network. The proposed system consists of five components including blcokchain-to-device interface, chain code execution interface, membership service provider (MSP), peers node and ordering node. The proposed system consists of five components including HTTP-based API gateway as device-to-blockchain interface, membership service provider (MSP), peers node and orderer. At first, the API gateway receives sensing data from IoT gateway device. Upon reception, the API gateway acting as client invokes chain code installed in each blockchain peer by emitting a transaction proposal to peers. Peers then simulate the execution and send back the endorsed data to the client i.e. API gateway. Collected endorsement from various peers are sent to orderer which then build a block containing an ordered transactions received from all clients and then broadcast that block to all peers. Each peer the performs a final verification before committing all ordered transactions on that block into its own local ledger. By using this mechanism, every peer in network can receive similar transaction orders which lead to identical ledger state changes.","","978-1-7281-5163-2","10.1109/NICS48868.2019.9023797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9023797","","Logic gates;Peer-to-peer computing;Sensors;Internet of Things;Medical services;Cloud computing","application program interfaces;body area networks;computer network security;cryptography;data integrity;distributed databases;health care;Internet of Things;internetworking;medical information systems;transaction processing","blockchain peer;endorsed data;API gateway;ordered transactions;smart healthcare system;blockchain network;personal health data;wireless body area network;data confidentiality;permissioned blockchain;storage platform;data integrity;software platform;integration layer;blcokchain-to-device interface;chain code execution interface;membership service provider;peers node;ordering node;device-to-blockchain interface;sensing data;IoT gateway device;IoT-to-blockchain platform;Internet of Things;HTTP-based API gateway","","14","","8","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These models also generalize the monotonic transform model of Sandhu, and its non-monotonic extension (NMT) by Sandhu and Suri. The authors argue that NMT is inadequate for expressing the document release example discussed by Sandhu and Suri, because it can test only one access matrix cell in its state changing commands.

Notable examples are DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security and DYN, which have been performed by IoT devices part of botnets. We take a first step towards detecting P2P botnets in IoT, by proposing AutoBotCatcher, whose design is driven by the consideration that bots of the same botnet frequently communicate with each other and form communities. As such, the purpose of AutoBotCatcher is to dynamically analyze communities of IoT devices, formed according to their network traffic flows, to detect botnets. AutoBotCatcher exploits a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain, as a state transition machine that allows collaboration of multiple parties without trust, in order to perform collaborative and dynamic botnet detection by collecting and auditing IoT devices' network traffic flows as blockchain transactions. In this paper, we focus on the design of the AutoBotCatcher by first defining the blockchain structure underlying AutoBot-Catcher, then discussing its components.","","978-1-5386-9502-9","10.1109/CIC.2018.00-46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8537811","Blockchain;Internet of Things;Security;P2P botnets;Botnet detection","Botnet;Generators;Internet of Things;Collaboration;Performance evaluation;Computer crime","computer network security;Internet;Internet of Things;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","Byzantine fault tolerant blockchain;dynamic botnet detection;collaborative botnet detection;IoT devices part;DDoS attacks;malicious parties;decentralized P2P structure;malicious purposes;compromised internet computers;Blockchain-Based P2P;AutoBotCatcher","","28","","28","IEEE","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple-stride deterministic finite automaton (DFA) increases the performance of pattern matching, because they allow multiple bytes of a packet to be scanned simultaneously. However, traditional multiple-stride DFA either rely on specific hardware for parallel comparison or have a huge memory requirements due to state explosion. In this paper, we present a high throughput, multiple-stride pattern-matching architecture that requires a small storage cost and no specific hardware. The basic idea is to group DFA states/transitions into three coarse-grained and variable-size blocks, so that each individual block can employ different-specific methods to optimize storage requirements and performance. The blocks are naturally identified based on basic observations of DFA characteristics: prefix, linear trie and state dependencies. The performance evaluation is done using the Snort pattern sets. We show that multi-byte striding DFA achieves multi Gb/s pure content inspection in software, while utilizing <3 bytes per pattern character.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxq077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8130271","pattern matching;memory and performance optimization;deep packet inspection;network security","","","","","5","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The only proper way to protect a smart contract is to fix potential risks in its code before it is deployed to the blockchain. However, existing tools for smart contract security analysis focus on the detection of bugs but seldom consider the code fix issues. Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to understand and fix flawed code manually. In this paper we propose SMARTSHIELD, a bytecode rectification system, to fix three typical security-related bugs (i.e., state changes after external calls, missing checks for out-of-bound arithmetic operations, and missing checks for failing external calls) in smart contracts automatically and help developers release secure contracts. Moreover, SMARTSHIELD guarantees that the rectified contract is not only immune to certain attacks but also gas-friendly (i.e., a slightly increase of gas cost). To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of SMARTSHIELD, we applied it to 28,621 real-world buggy contracts on Ethereum blockchain (as of January 2nd2019). Experiment results demonstrated that among 95,502 insecure cases in those contracts, 87,346 (91.5%) of them were automatically fixed by SMARTSHIELD. A following test with both program analysis and real-world exploits further testified that the rectified contracts were secure against common attacks. Moreover, the rectification only introduced a 0.2 % gas increment for each contract on average.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-5143-4","10.1109/SANER48275.2020.9054825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9054825","Ethereum blockchain;Smart contract;Automated bug fix;Bytecode rectification","Codes;Costs;Smart contracts;Computer bugs;Semantics;Transforms;Software","contracts;cryptography;distributed databases;program debugging","security response mechanisms;smart contract security analysis;Ethereum blockchain;real-world buggy contracts;rectified contract;secure contracts;security-related bugs;bytecode rectification system;flawed code;code fix issues;code patching;automatic smart contract protection;SMARTSHIELD","","25","","68","IEEE","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The result is a new paradigm known as distributed trust; this article attempts to survey that landscape. ""Divide and conquer"" can be a powerful tool for disentangling complexity when designing a computing system. However, some aspects of system design are inseparable. Treating these as though they were independent leads to one interfering with the other, and ""divide and be conquered"" perhaps better characterizes the consequences. For some years, we have been investigating how to construct systems that continue functioning despite component failures and attacks. A question we have pondered is to what extent does divide and conquer apply? Somewhat less than you might hope is, unfortunately, the answer. One could argue that attacks can be seen as just another cause for component failure. The Byzantine fault model asserts that a faulty component can exhibit arbitrarily malicious (so-called ""Byzantine"") behavior; a system that tolerates Byzantine faults should then be able to handle anything. Moreover, because any component can be viewed abstractly in terms of its state and a set of possible next-state transitions - in short, a state machine - fault-tolerant services can be built by assembling enough state-machine copies so that outputs from the ones exhibiting Byzantine behavior are outvoted by the correctly functioning ones. The fault-tolerance of the ensemble thus exceeds the fault-tolerance of any individual state machine, and a distributed fault-tolerance is the result. A closer look at such replicated state machines, however, reveals problems ""when attacks are possible. Specific difficulties with the approach and how we can overcome these are described later in this article, but the overall vision remains compelling: place more trust in an ensemble than in any of its individual components. In analogy with distributed fault-tolerance, then, we are seeking ways to implement distributed trust.","1558-4046","","10.1109/MSP.2005.125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514398","cryptography;trusted systems;state machines","Cryptography;Computer security;Privacy;Resists;Hardware;Cryptographic protocols;Computational modeling;Distributed computing;Computer crime","security of data;software fault tolerance;client-server systems;divide and conquer methods;finite state machines","trustworthy service;replicated state machine;distributed trust;divide and conquer method;computing system design;Byzantine fault model;faulty component;fault-tolerant services;distributed fault-tolerance","","13","3","37","IEEE","3 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Homomorphic encryption ensures the biometric payload is always one-way encrypted with no need for key management and provides full privacy by ensuring plaintext biometrics are never received by the SBP server. The SBP implementation includes software running on a client device and on the SPB server. Pluggable components are used to replace legacy functionality to allow rapid integration into existing operating environments. The SBP implementation allows the systems to meet security needs by using the application programming interface, whether the underlying system is a relational database management system or a search engine. The SBP implementation functionality offers a “point-and-cut” mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production systems as well as to the systems in development.

There exist a manifold of different reasons for system failures of devices starting from short-circuits, hardware defects or malware infections reaching to power shortages or complete blackouts. Moreover, the increase of the number of devices within the airport infrastructure system leads to a tremendous demand of computational assistance systems for operations management. As most devices within the airport are directly connected to processes, there is a high demand for identifying and managing system failures immediately and increase the system resilience. Thus, we introduce process-oriented-grouping of network devices and use linear algebra to relate the impact of system state changes to airport processes, such as check-in, security checks et cetera. This connection between system state and processes is inevitable for a successful combination of computational approaches to determine physical state variations, induced by power grid instabilities and/or cyber-attacks, and process oriented simulation methods. Matrix relations between system states, process capacities, waiting times are given and applied to a small, at this state fictional airport infrastructure. This application shows that forecasting of quantitative values for airport processes is a beneficial tool for airport infrastructure management. Moreover, linear algebra properties prove to be a strong tool in analyzing network properties, such as infrastructure diversity and process capacities, which play a major role within resource management. However, at the moment our approach is only suitable as a supporting tool for human decision making.

The PRO3, which is integrated with a high-speed line card, attempts to accelerate the performance of the firewall by implementing key functionality in hardware and by optimizing the balance between hardware and software functions. In this way, significant performance enhancements can be achieved, such as making transport control protocol (TCP) and Internet protocol (IP) data transactions secure, and protecting and separating virtual private networks (VPNs) from the external public network. The PRO3 incorporates an innovative scheme—a reduced instruction set computing (RISC)-based pipelined module with line-rate throughput—that makes it possible to process high- and low-level streaming operations efficiently.

On the other hand, side-channel analysis has emerged as an effective approach for detection of such large sequential Trojans. However, existing side-channel approaches suffer from large reduction in detection sensitivity with increasing process variations or decreasing Trojan size. In this paper, we propose TeSR, a Temporal Self-Referencing approach that compares the current signature of a chip at two different time windows to completely eliminate the effect of process noise, thus providing high detection sensitivity for Trojans of varying size. Furthermore, unlike existing approaches, it does not require golden chip instances as a reference.

In particular, concealment mechanisms must modify well-known data structures, which could be detected trivially otherwise. We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations. We argue that the resulting observations will provide a novel sensor datum for intrusion detection but may also be used as a standalone probabilistic detection mechanism particularly suited to detect attacks in progress.","","978-1-4244-6232-2","10.1109/ICONS.2010.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464146","Intrusion Detection;Computational Model;Asymmetric Concurrency;Memory Observation","Costs;Concurrent computing;Kernel;Interference;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Computer architecture;Information security;Data structures;Intrusion detection","concurrency control;data structures;invasive software","observation mechanism;cost model;tightly coupled asymmetric concurrency;malicious code;second-order operation;privilege escalation;concealment mechanism;data structures;concurrent observations;interleaved linearization;concurrent processing units;computational model;forced synchronization;resource contention","","3","","19","IEEE","13 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The IG is constructed by the CF data generated from a CF model considering balance rules and hidden failure. Then two IG based indexes are employed to investigate CF pattern from two perspective, vulnerability and dispersibility. The simulation results have shown CF propagation pattern transferences in two system state evolutions and verified the critical lines could transfer with system states changing.

The model provides for enforcement of access control protocols through FSM specification on units of data that can vary in size from one region of memory to another. Threads executing transactions do not explicitly request locks on data items-they simply access the data items while locking is performed automatically and in many instances without software intervention. This is facilitated by hardware assistance in that the FSM definitions and lock unit state information is stored in caches. Only when a thread is suspended are the state changes communicated to the software lock manager. Delays for lock acquisitions through the MVM model architecture are determined and compared to delays due to lock acquisition by a conventional lock manager.","1098-8068","0-8186-8114-4","10.1109/IDEAS.1997.625700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=625700","","Access protocols;Access control;Hardware;Protection;Yarn;Memory management;Operating systems;Computer architecture;Delay;Resource management","concurrency control;distributed databases;network operating systems;transaction processing;authorisation;security of data;memory protocols;finite state machines;cache storage;storage management;database theory","multi-view memory model;OS locking;operating system locking;transaction processing systems;access control protocols;FSM specification;threads;lock unit state information;cache;software lock manager;delays;MVM model architecture;lock acquisition;concurrency control;finite state machines","","1","14","39","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A severity score calculation is proposed based on VPRM: the vulnerability severity score is typically the sum of consequence as a result of state changes of every evolving property in the vulnerable property relationship model.

Recently, radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based identification schemes have attracted wide attention as they extract the inherent characteristics of hardware circuits which is very hard to forge. However, existing RF fingerprint-based approaches face the problems of unstable region of interest (ROI), high-cost feature design, and incomplete automation. To address these problems, this paper proposes a multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract RF fingerprint from the selected ROI for classifying ZigBee devices. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive ROI selection algorithm is also developed to alleviate the effect of semi-steady behavior of ZigBee devices owing to sleep mode switching. The proposed MSCNN uses multiple downsampling transformations for multiscale feature extraction and classification automatically. To validate and evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we design a testbed consisting of one low-cost universal software radio peripheral (USRP) as the receiver and 54 CC2530 devices as targets for identification. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MSCNN both in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. The classification accuracy is as high as 97% under the LOS scenarios around SNR = 30 dB. Our scheme is robust over a wide range of SNRs under the LOS scenarios as well as under the NLOS scenarios.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2911347","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571110,61602113,61601114); National Natural Science Youth Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801115); Purple Mountain Laboratories (PML); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692418","Multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN);radio frequency (RF) fingerprint;region of interest (ROI) selection;semi-steady portion;ZigBee","Feature extraction;Radio frequency;Zigbee;Internet of Things;Signal to noise ratio;Performance evaluation;Receivers","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;Internet of Things;signal classification;software radio;Zigbee","multiscale feature extraction;low-cost universal software radio peripheral;MSCNN;LOS scenarios;robust RF fingerprinting approach;multisampling convolutional neural network;device identification;radio frequency fingerprint-based identification schemes;hardware circuits;high-cost feature design;ZigBee devices;ROI selection algorithm;semisteady behavior;unstable region of interest;RF fingerprint-based approaches;signal-to-noise ratio adaptive ROI selection algorithm;downsampling transformations","","83","","58","IEEE","16 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior works require multiple access points (AP) deployed in the tracking region or to utilize elaborately selected multipaths in an indoor environment to achieve tracking. However, this prevents their wide adoption because scenarios like homes typically only have a single AP, and using multipaths is vulnerable to unexpected interferences due to the complex indoor environment. This paper proposes a tracking system using only a single AP. The insight behind the proposed system is to mine the multi-dimensional channel parameters from the direct path to realize tracking. Therefore, we develop a model that establishes the correlation between the target motion and channel parameters, including the direct path's angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD). Then, we can formulate the tracking problem as the state transition with the observations. Since the nonlinear observation equation, we use particle filters to solve the problem accurately. Finally, we validate the proposed system via simulation using ray-tracing software. The simulation results show that the median tracking error is 0.21 m based on a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), comparable to previous state-of-the-art systems.","2166-9589","978-1-6654-8053-6","10.1109/PIMRC54779.2022.9977459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9977459","Indoor tracking;single access point;wireless channel model;direct path;particle filter","Wireless communication;Target tracking;Simulation;Ray tracing;Mathematical models;Software;Indoor environment","direction-of-arrival estimation;image motion analysis;indoor radio;Kalman filters;multipath channels;particle filtering (numerical methods);radiowave propagation;ray tracing;target tracking;tracking;wireless LAN","complex indoor environment;decimeter level indoor tracking;direct path;elaborately selected multipaths;elderly care;median tracking error;multidimensional channel parameters;multiple access points;noise figure 20.0 dB;nonlinear observation equation;previous state-of-the-art systems;security monitoring;single access point;single AP;size 0.21 m;target motion;tracking problem;tracking region;tracking system;unexpected interferences","","","","10","IEEE","20 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

That is, they protect Trusted Applications (TAs) even if the Operating System or the hypervisor are compromised. The TEE runs in parallel with the OS and leverages a set of hardware and software components to create such an isolated environment. However, this isolation can be broken by exploiting microarchitectural side-channels. The state of the shared components of multi-core processors depends on the actual processes being executed, and as a result, some information is leaked from one process to any other running in the same processor. This leakage completely breaks the confidentiality guarantees that TEEs promise. The only way to completely avoid the leakage is to avoid the share of resources, but this is nearly impossible to achieve without a huge degradation in the performance of the processor. Assuming that it is possible that the leakage exists, and the attacker only can get information from the observable microarchitectural state, we propose to monitor the hardware resources to detect the microarchitectural state changes caused by the attacks. To this end, we have implemented a hardware module that compares at runtime pre-stored microarchitectural execution signatures of each enclave, with the actual execution trace, and triggers an alarm when it detects significant variation.","2640-5563","978-1-7281-9132-4","10.1109/DCIS51330.2020.9268660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268660","Microarchitectural attacks;CUSUM;DTW;TEE;Performance Counters","Hardware;Microarchitecture;Program processors;Security;Monitoring;Registers;VHDL","data protection;digital signatures;operating systems (computers);program diagnostics;resource allocation;trusted computing","microarchitectural isolation guarantees;confidentiality;trusted applications;operating system;microarchitectural side channels;multicore processors;execution trace;trusted execution environments;microarchitectural execution signatures;hypervisor;parallel TEE;information leakage","","","","35","IEEE","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Privacy is a huge concern for IoT devices as personal information is constantly being shared through them. Though the best industrial standards like end-to-end encryption are being followed to ensure content-based privacy, contextual privacy concerns still exist. This study focuses on user activity inference attacks, where a passive network observer can infer the private in-home activity of a user by analyzing encrypted IoT traffic metadata. Most of the previous solutions addressing these attacks have either reduced the usability of the devices, increased data overhead, or failed against packet-level signature-based attack scenarios. This study introduces a new defense mechanism that combines dummy packet generation with dynamic link padding. This process makes it difficult for the adversary to avail contextual information about the state of the device (ON or OFF), along with the temporal information (time of state change) from encrypted IoT traffic metadata. We reverse the packet-level signature-based attacks to get device-specific signatures, which helps us generate dummy traffic for the duration of device-specific signatures. Consequently, this results in increased false positives for device state identifications and low traffic overhead. We simulate a state-of-the-art attack scenario to test and vindicate our solution over existing data sets.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3126453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609087","Contextual privacy;Internet of Things (IoT);smart devices;traffic shaping","Smart homes;Privacy;Object recognition;Internet of Things;Metadata;Information technology;Encryption","computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;home automation;Internet of Things;telecommunication traffic","preserving contextual privacy;smart home IoT devices;dynamic traffic shaping;physical devices;personal information;end-to-end encryption;contextual privacy concerns;user activity inference attacks;passive network observer;in-home activity;encrypted IoT traffic metadata;increased data overhead;packet-level signature-based attack scenarios;dummy packet generation;dynamic link padding;contextual information;temporal information;packet-level signature-based attacks;device-specific signatures;dummy traffic;device state identifications;low traffic overhead;state-of-the-art attack scenario","","2","","20","IEEE","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
